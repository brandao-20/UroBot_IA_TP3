"6.2.3.1	  Indications for prophylactic pelvic lymph node dissection  6.2.3.1.1	 Risk factors for pelvic nodal metastasis  To identify patients with pelvic LN metastasis in the absence of radiological evidence for LN involvement,   several studies have tried to develop generalized estimating models based on inguinal characteristics using   logistic regression and multivariate analysis. Among various predictors, the number of positive inguinal   LNs (1–2 vs. 3, or more, with no extra-capsular extension) was associated with positive pelvic LNs in   0–6.5% of patients vs. 33–67% of patients [249, 250]. The presence of extracapsular spread was also   consistently significantly associated with positive ipsilateral pelvic LN metastasis in 4 studies [249-252] Strong   immunoreactivity of p53, LN density > 30% and primary tumour grade are also reported as predictors of pelvic   LN involvement [250].",
Summary of evidence,LE
Open radical ILND is the standard for cN1–2 disease.,2a
Radical inguinal lymph node dissection carries a significant risk of complications (21–55%).,2a
"A single study reported on fsILND, fascial-sparing ILND has been reported (single study) and in cN1–2   disease which appears to offer similar oncological outcomes, and reduced complications.",2b
"Lymph node yield and LND appear related to survival, however, variance in accepted values,   pathological assessment, and stage migration prevent recommendation of a specific LN count.",2a
Delay in nodal management of more than three to six months may affect DFS.,3
"Minimally-invasive approaches for ILND (VEIL/RAVEIL) generally have longer operative times,   equivalent LN yields, shorter length of hospital stay and lower wound complications when   compared with open ILND. However, since current evidence is very limited in cN1–2 patients, no   recommendation for minimally-invasive approaches can be provided.",2b
