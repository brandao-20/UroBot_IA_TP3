"5.7	  Impact on fertility and fertility-associated issues  Sperm abnormalities and Leydig cell dysfunction are frequently found in patients with TCs prior to   orchidectomy [89, 90]. Up to 24% of TC patients are azoospermic and almost 50% have abnormal sperm   counts (oligozo-ospemic) before treatment [90].",
Summary of evidence,LE
"Patients with stage I seminoma have, in general, a low risk of recurrence",2a
Primary testicular tumour size correlates with the risk of relapse. Stromal rete testis invasion and other   factors such as vascular invasion or epididymal invasion show a less reliable correlation with the risk   of relapse.,2a
"The evidence to guide adjuvant treatment decisions upon risk factors is, however, still too limited to   justify routine use in clinical practice.",2a
Active surveillance is a feasible approach with conditional relapse risk in unselected series of between   12-20%.,2a
