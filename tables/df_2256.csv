Metastatic disease in a first-line setting,,
M1 patients*  All statements   are based on   metastatic disease   defined by bone   scintigraphy and    CT scan/MRI.,"Offer immediate systemic treatment with androgen deprivation therapy   (ADT) to palliate symptoms and reduce the risk for potentially serious   sequelae of advanced disease (spinal cord compression, pathological   fractures, ureteral obstruction) to M1 symptomatic patients.",Strong
,At the start of ADT offer luteinising hormone-releasing hormone   (LHRH) antagonists or orchiectomy to patients with impending clinical   complications like spinal cord compression or bladder outlet obstruction.,Strong
,Offer early systemic treatment to M1 patients asymptomatic from their   tumour.,Strong
,Offer short-term administration of an older generation androgen   receptor (AR) antagonist to M1 patients starting LHRH agonist to   reduce the risk of the ‘flare-up’ phenomenon.,Weak
,Do not offer AR antagonist monotherapy to patients with M1 disease.,Strong
,Discuss combination therapy including ADT plus systemic therapy   with all M1 patients.,Strong
,Do not offer ADT monotherapy to patients whose first presentation is   M1 disease if they have no contra-indications for combination therapy   and have a sufficient life expectancy to benefit from combination therapy   (> 1 year) and are willing to accept the increased risk of side effects.,Strong
,Offer ADT combined with abiraterone acetate plus prednisone or   apalutamide or enzalutamide to patients with M1 disease and who are   fit for the regimen.,Strong
,Offer docetaxel only in combination with ADT plus abiraterone or   darolutamide to patients with M1 disease and who are fit for docetaxel.,Strong
,Offer ADT combined with non-curative prostate radiotherapy (using   doses up to the equivalent of 72 Gy in 2 Gy fractions) to patients   whose first presentation is M1 disease and who have low volume of   disease by CHAARTED criteria/M1a disease.,Strong
,Do not offer ADT combined with any local treatment (RT/surgery) to   patients with high-volume (CHAARTED criteria) M1 disease outside of   clinical trials (except for symptom control).,Strong
,Do not offer ADT combined with surgery to M1 patients outside of   clinical trials.,Strong
,Only offer metastasis-directed therapy to M1 patients within a clinical   trial setting or well-designed prospective cohort study.,Strong
Biochemical recurrence after treatment with curative intent,,
Biochemical  recurrence (BCR)  after radical  prostatectomy  (RP),"Offer monitoring, including PSA, to EAU Low-Risk BCR patients.",Weak
,Offer early salvage intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT)/volumetric   arc radiation therapy (VMAT) plus image-guided radiotherapy (IGRT) to   men with two consecutive PSA rises.,Strong
,"A negative positron emission tomography/computed tomography   (PET/CT) scan should not delay salvage radiotherapy (SRT), if   otherwise indicated.",Strong
,"Do not wait for a PSA threshold before starting treatment. Once the   decision for SRT has been made, SRT (at least 64 Gy) should be given   as soon as possible.",Strong
,Offer hormonal therapy in addition to SRT to men with BCR.,Weak
BCR after  RT,"Offer monitoring, including PSA, to EAU Low-Risk BCR patients.",Weak
,"Only offer salvage radical prostatectomy (SRP), brachytherapy,   stereotactic body RT, high-intensity focused ultrasound, or   cryosurgical ablation to highly selected patients with biopsy-proven   local recurrence within a clinical trial setting or well-designed   prospective cohort study undertaken in experienced centres.",Strong
Systemic salvage   treatment,Do not offer ADT to M0 patients with a PSA-doubling time (DT) > 12   months.,Strong
