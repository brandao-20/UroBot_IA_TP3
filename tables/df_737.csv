"Summary of evidence and guidelines for transurethral resection of the bladder,",
Summary of evidence,LE
Transurethral resection of the bladder tumour (TURB) followed by pathology investigation of the   obtained specimen(s) is an essential step in the management of NMIBC.,1
The absence of detrusor muscle in the specimen is associated with a significantly higher risk of   residual disease and tumour under-staging (with the exception of Ta LG/G1 tumours).,2b
"A second TURB can detect residual tumours and tumour under-staging, increase recurrence-free   survival, improve outcomes after BCG treatment and provide prognostic information.",2
Recommendations,Strength rating
"In patients suspected of having bladder cancer, perform a transurethral resection of the   bladder tumour (TURB) followed by pathology investigation of the obtained specimen(s) as   a diagnostic procedure and initial treatment step.",Strong
"Perform TURB systematically in individual steps:  •   bimanual palpation under anaesthesia;   •   insertion of the resectoscope, under visual control with inspection of the whole urethra;  •   inspection of the whole urothelial lining of the bladder;  •   biopsy from the prostatic urethra (if indicated);  •   cold-cup bladder biopsies (if indicated);  •   resection of the tumour;  •   recording of findings in the surgery report/record;  •   precise description of the specimen(s) for pathology evaluation.",Strong
Performance of individual steps,
"Perform en-bloc resection or resection in fractions (exophytic part of the tumour, the   underlying bladder wall and the edges of the resection area).",Strong
Avoid cauterisation as much as possible during TURB to avoid tissue deterioration.,Strong
"Take biopsies from abnormal-looking urothelium. Biopsies from normal-looking mucosa   (mapping biopsies from the trigone, bladder dome, right, left, anterior and posterior bladder   wall) are recommended if cytology or urinary molecular marker test is positive. If the   equipment is available, perform fluorescence-guided (PDD) biopsies.",Strong
"Take a biopsy of the prostatic urethra in cases of bladder neck tumour, if there is positive   cytology or urinary molecular marker test without evidence of tumour in the bladder, or if   abnormalities of the prostatic urethra are visible. If biopsy is not performed during the initial   procedure, it should be performed at the time of the second resection.",Strong
Take a prostatic urethral biopsy from the pre-collicular area (between the 5 and 7 o’clock   position) using a resection loop.,Weak
"Use methods to improve tumour visualisation (fluorescence cystoscopy, narrow-band   imaging) during TURB, if available.",Weak
Refer the specimens from different biopsies and resection fractions to the pathologist in   separately labelled containers.,Weak
"The TURB record must describe tumour location, appearance, size and multifocality, all   steps of the procedure, extent, macroscopic completeness of resection as well as any   complications.",Strong
"In patients with positive cytology, but negative cystoscopy, exclude an upper tract urothelial   carcinoma, CIS in the bladder (by mapping biopsies or PDD-guided biopsies) and tumour in   the prostatic urethra (by prostatic urethra biopsy).",Strong
"Perform a second TURB in the following situations:  •   after incomplete initial TURB, or in case of doubt about completeness of a TURB;   •   if there is no detrusor muscle in the specimen after initial resection, with the    exception of Ta LG/G1 tumours and primary CIS;  •   in T1 tumours.",Strong
"If indicated, perform a second TURB within 2–6 weeks after the initial resection. This   second TURB should include resection of the primary tumour site.",Weak
Register the pathology results of a second TURB as it reflects the quality of the initial resection.  Weak,
"Inform the pathologist of prior treatments (intravesical therapy, radiotherapy, etc.).",Strong
"The pathological report should specify tumour location, tumour grade and stage, lympho-  vascular invasion, subtypes of urothelial carcinoma, presence of CIS and detrusor muscle.",Strong
