8.2.3.1.5	 Summary of evidence for conservative treatment of Peyronie’s disease,
Recommendations,Strength rating
Offer conservative treatment to patients not fit for surgery or when surgery is not acceptable   to the patient.,Strong
Fully counsel patients regarding all available treatment options and outcomes before   starting any treatment.,Strong
"Do not offer oral treatment with vitamin E, potassium para-aminobenzoate (potaba),   tamoxifen, pentoxifylline, colchicine and acetyl esters of carnitine to treat Peyronie’s disease   (PD).",Strong
Use nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs to treat penile pain in the acute phase of PD.,Strong
Use extracorporeal shockwave treatment (ESWT) to treat penile pain in the acute phase of   PD.,Weak
Use phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors to treat concomitant erectile dysfunction or if the   deformity results in difficulty in penetrative intercourse in order to optimise penetration.,Weak
Offer intralesional therapy with interferon alpha-2b to patients with stable curvature dorsal   or lateral > 30o seeking a minimal invasive procedure.,Strong
"Offer intralesional therapy with Collagenase Clostridium Histolyticum to patients with stable   PD and dorsal or lateral curvature > 30o, who request non-surgical treatment, although the   placebo effects are high.",Strong
"Do not offer intralesional treatment with steroids to reduce penile curvature, plaque size or   pain.",Strong
"Do not use intralesional platelet-rich plasma or hyaluronic acid, either alone or in   combination with oral treatment, to reduce penile curvature, plaque size or pain outside the   confines of a clinical trial.",Weak
Do not offer ESWT to improve penile curvature and reduce plaque size.,Strong
"Offer penile traction devices and vacuum devices to reduce penile deformity or as part of a   multimodal therapy approach, although outcome data is limited.",Weak
