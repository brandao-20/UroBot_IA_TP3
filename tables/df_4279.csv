4.4.4	  Summary of evidence and recommendations for the evaluation and management of urethral   trauma,
Summary of evidence,LE
Implementing training programmes on urinary catheter insertion for personnel involved with urethral   catheterisation significantly improves the rate of catheter-related complications.,2b
"In males, a urethral injury is detected as contrast extravasation during urethrography or as a mucosal   laceration during cysto-urethroscopy.",3
"As opposed to cysto-urethroscopy, voiding cysto-urethrography will miss a female urethral injury in   approximately 50% of cases.",3
Transurethral or suprapubic urinary diversion are the treatment options for iatrogenic injuries.,3
With urinary diversion (suprapubic or transurethral catheter) satisfactory urethral luminal   re-canalisation may occur after partial blunt anterior urethral ruptures.,3
"Complete blunt anterior urethral ruptures are unlikely to be cured by urinary diversion alone, whereas   immediate urethroplasty has an equal success rate compared to delayed urethroplasty. The main   advantage of immediate urethroplasty is to reduce the time to spontaneous voiding.",3
"If PFUIs are associated with life-threatening injuries, urethral management has no priority and urinary   diversion with either urethral or suprapubic catheterisation is sufficient initially.",3
With early endoscopic re-alignment the stricture rate is reduced to 44-49% without increased risk of   incontinence or erectile dysfunction.,3
Repetitive endoscopic treatments after failed re-alignment delay the time to definitive cure and   increase the incidence of adverse events.,3
"For partial posterior injuries, urinary diversion (suprapubic or transurethral) is sufficient as these injuries   might heal without significant scarring or obstruction.",3
"Immediate urethroplasty (< 48 hours) in male PFUI is associated with a higher risk of bleeding,   stricture, incontinence, and impotence rates compared to delayed urethroplasty.",3
"In selected patients for male PFUI, early urethroplasty (two days to six weeks) is associated with   similar stricture, incontinence and impotence rates compared to delayed urethroplasty.",3
Suprapubic diversion with delayed urethroplasty in male PFUI with complete urethral disruption is   associated with an 86% stricture free success rate and with no significant impact on erectile function   and urinary continence.,2a
Early repair in female PFUI has the lowest complication rate.,3
