Table 7.3: Treatment options for the various categories of BCG failure,
EAU Risk Group: Intermediate,
"In all patients either one-year full-dose Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) treatment (induction   plus 3-weekly instillations at 3, 6 and 12 months), or instillations of chemotherapy (the optimal   schedule is not known) for a maximum of one year is recommended. The final choice should   reflect the individual patient’s risk of recurrence and progression as well as the efficacy and   side effects of each treatment modality. Offer one immediate chemotherapy instillation to   patients with small papillary recurrences detected more than one year after previous TURB.",Strong
EAU risk group: High,
Offer intravesical full-dose BCG instillations for one to 3 years but discuss immediate radical   Strong  cystectomy (RC).,
EAU risk group: Very High,
Offer RC or intravesical full-dose BCG instillations for one to 3 years to those who refuse or   Strong  are unfit for RC.,
