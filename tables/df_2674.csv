"3.1.10.4	  Steroids  Steroids have a large number of side effects [242-244, 295], especially with long-term use. Most practitioners   still consider steroids (either prednisolone or methylprednisolone) to be a fundamental adjunct to primary   immunosuppression, even though successful steroid withdrawal has been achieved in the vast majority of   patients in many prospective, randomised trials [242, 244, 245, 295, 300, 301]. The risk of steroid withdrawal   depends on the use of concomitant immunosuppressive medication, immunological risk, ethnicity, and   time after transplantation. Although the risk of rejection diminishes over time, potential benefits may be less   prominent after a prolonged steroid treatment period [242-245, 295]. Recent studies suggest similar efficacy   but less diabetes after early steroid withdrawal or steroid minimisation in low-risk patients treated with   tacrolimus, MPA and induction (either basiliximab or ATG) [302, 303].",
Recommendations,Strength rating
"Monitor transplant recipients for signs of acute rejection, particularly during the first six   months post-transplant.",Strong
Take regular blood samples in addition to regular monitoring of urine output and ultrasound   examinations in order to detect graft dysfunction during hospitalisation.,Strong
Immediately rule out other potential causes of graft dysfunction in cases of suspected acute   rejection. An ultrasound of the kidney transplant should be performed.,Strong
"Perform a renal biopsy, graded according to the most recent Banff criteria, in patients with   suspected acute rejection episodes.",Strong
"Only if contraindications to renal biopsy are present, can ‘blind’ steroid bolus therapy be   given.",Strong
Test patients who suffer acute rejection as soon as possible for anti-HLA antibodies against   the graft.,Strong
"Reassess the immunosuppressive therapy of all patients with rejection, including patient   adherence to the medication, which is of particular importance in late rejections.",Strong
