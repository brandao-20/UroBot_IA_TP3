Summary of evidence,LE
No contemporary data exists to support that pre-operative RT for operable MIBC increases survival.,2a
"Pre-operative RT for operable MIBC, using a dose of 45–50 Gy in fractions of 1.8–2 Gy, results in   down-staging after 4 to 6 weeks.",2
Limited evidence supports the safe use of pre- and post-operative RT in case a neobladder is planned   or in situ.,3
Limited high-quality evidence supports the use of pre-operative RT to decrease local recurrence of   MIBC after RC.,3
"Addition of adjuvant RT to chemotherapy is associated with an improvement in local relapse-free   survival following cystectomy for locally-advanced bladder cancer (pT3b–4, or node-positive).",2a
