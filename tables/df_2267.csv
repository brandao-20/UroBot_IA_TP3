Table 3.2: Main dietary factors that have been associated with PCa,
Alcohol,"High alcohol intake, but also total abstention from alcohol has been associated with   a higher risk of PCa and PCa-specific mortality [62]. A meta-analysis shows a dose-  response relationship with PCa [63]."
Coffee,Coffee consumption may be associated with a reduced risk of PCa; with a pooled RR   of 0.91 for the highest category of coffee consumption [64].
Dairy,A weak correlation between high intake of protein from dairy products and the risk of   PCa was found [65].
Fat,No association between intake of long-chain omega-3 poly-unsaturated fatty acids   and PCa was found [66]. A relation between intake of fried foods and risk of PCa may   exist [67].
Tomatoes   (lycopenes/  carotenes),"A trend towards a favourable effect of tomato intake (mainly cooked) and lycopenes on   PCa incidence has been identified in meta-analyses [68, 69]. Randomised controlled   trials comparing lycopene with placebo did not identify a significant decrease in the   incidence of PCa [70]."
Meat,"Meta-analyses show a potential association between red meat, total meat, and   processed meat consumption and PCa [71, 72]."
Soy   (phytoestrogens   [isoflavones/  coumestans]),"Phytoestrogen intake was significantly associated with a reduced risk of PCa in a   meta-analysis [73]. Total soy food intake has been associated with a reduced risk of   PCa, but also with an increased risk of advanced disease [74, 75]."
Vitamin D,"A U-shaped association has been observed, with both low- and high vitamin-D   concentrations being associated with an increased risk of PCa, and more strongly for   high-grade disease [75, 76]."
Vitamin E/Selenium,"An inverse association of blood, but mainly nail selenium levels (reflecting long-term   exposure) with aggressive PCa have been found [77, 78]. Selenium and Vitamin E   supplementation were, however, found not to affect PCa incidence [79]."
Summary of evidence,LE
"Prostate cancer is a major health concern in men, with incidence mainly dependent on age.",3
Genetic factors are associated with risk of (aggressive) PCa.,3
A variety of dietary/exogenous/environmental factors have been associated with PCa incidence and   prognosis.,3
"In hypogonadal men, testosterone supplements do not increase the risk of PCa.",2a
No conclusive data exist which could support specific preventive or dietary measures aimed at   reducing the risk of developing PCa.,1a
