"9.3.2.2	  Surgical treatment of congenital intrinsic penile shortness  Current literature reports a wide spectrum of possible surgical interventions aimed to address penile   shortness. Nonetheless, the proposed spectrum of surgical interventions starts from less invasive procedures   - such as suspensory ligament release (SLR) - to more complex genital reconstruction - such as total phallic   reconstruction (TPR) [1493, 1494]. These issues make the surgical treatment of congenital intrinsic penile   shortness a surgical challenge in urology.",
Summary of evidence,LE
Various surgical procedures may be considered to restore genital anatomy in AABP patients.,3
Acquired adult buried penis surgery is burdened by a significant incidence of postoperative   complications.,3
"Lifestyle changes and risk factor modifications, particularly weight loss, are widely considered as a   proactive approach to minimise AABP surgical complications.",4
Acquired adult buried penis surgery may provide satisfactory functional outcomes with a low   incidence of recurrence.,3
