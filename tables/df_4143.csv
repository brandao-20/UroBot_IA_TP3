"3.6.1.3	  Laboratory diagnosis  Urinalysis including the assessment of white and red blood cells and nitrite, is recommended for routine   diagnosis [192]. In addition, urine culture and antimicrobial susceptibility testing should be performed in all   cases of pyelonephritis.",
Summary of evidence,LE
Urine culture and antimicrobial susceptibility testing should be performed in all cases of pyelonephritis   in addition to urinalysis.,4
A prospective observational cohort study found that radiologic imaging can selectively be applied   in adults with febrile UTI without loss of clinically relevant information by using a simple clinical   prediction rule.,2b
"Additional imaging investigations, such as an unenhanced helical computed tomography should   be done if the patient remains febrile after 72 hours of treatment or in patients with suspected   complications e.g. sepsis.",4
