"5.2.8.1.2	 Transrectal prostate biopsy  An updated meta-analysis of eleven RCTs including 2,237 men showed that use of a rectal povidone-iodine   preparation before biopsy, in addition to antimicrobial prophylaxis, resulted in a significantly lower rate of   infectious complications (RR: 95% CI: 0.47 [0.36–0.61]) [301, 308-310]. Single RCTs showed no evidence of   benefit for perineal skin disinfection [311], but reported an advantage for rectal povidone-iodine preparation   before biopsy compared to after biopsy [312].  A meta-analysis of four RCTs including 671 men evaluated the use of rectal preparation by enema   before transrectal biopsy. No significant advantage was found regarding infectious complications (RR: 95%      CI: 0.96 [0.64–1.54]) [301].  An updated meta-analysis of 28 RCTs with 4,027 patients found no evidence that use of peri-  prostatic injection of local anaesthesia resulted in more infectious complications than no injection (RR: 95%   CI: 1.08 [0.79–1.48]) [300, 301, 313]. A meta-analysis of 9 RCTs including 2,230 patients found that extended   biopsy templates showed comparable infectious complications to standard templates (RR: 95% CI: 0.80      [0.53–1.22]) [301]. Additional meta-analyses found no difference in infectious complications regarding needle   guide type (disposable vs. reusable), needle type (coaxial vs. non-coaxial), needle size (large vs. small), and   number of injections for peri-prostatic nerve block (standard vs. extended) [301].",
Recommendations,Strength rating
"When performing systematic biopsy only, at least 12 cores are recommended.",Strong
Systematic transperineal biopsies are preferred over systematic transrectal biopsies for   detection of clinically significant PCa.,Strong
"Where magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has shown a suspicious lesion, MR-targeted   biopsy can be obtained through cognitive guidance, US/MR fusion software or direct   in-bore guidance.",Weak
