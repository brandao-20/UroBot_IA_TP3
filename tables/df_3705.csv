Summary of evidence,LE
ReDo VUA has patency rates of 60-91% in non-irradiated patients and 67% in irradiated patients with   obliterative VUAS or VUAS refractory to endoluminal treatment.,3
Urinary incontinence is inevitable after transperineal ReDo VUA. Artificial urinary sphincter placement   can be offered after three to six months if patency of ReDo VUA is ensured.,3
De novo incontinence with retropubic ReDo VUA is 0-58%.,3
