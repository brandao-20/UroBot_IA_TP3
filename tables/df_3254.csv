Summary of evidence,LE
Medical/sexual history taking and physical examination are essential parts of the evaluation of men   with a short penis complaint.,4
Among stretched penile measurements STT may underestimate erect penile length.,2b
"Among stretched penile measurements BTT has a better correlation with erect penile length,   especially in overweight and obese men.",2b
Flaccid and erect state measurements to assess penile length may add useful information on penile   size.,4
Penile girth assessment may add useful information on penile size and shape.,4
"The Body Dysmorphic Disorder Questionnaire, The Cosmetic Procedure Screening Scale for Penile   Dysmorphic Disorder, The Male Genital Self-Image Scale and the Index of Male Genital Image are self-  reported tools useful to screen patients at risk for psychopathology.",2b
"Mental health counselling is helpful in detecting men requesting penile augmentation procedures   present with strong psychological vulnerability, including BDD/PDD.",2b
"Validated questionnaire (e.g., APPSSI, BAPS, IIEF-15, MSHQ, EDITS) are helpful in assessing baseline   sexual function and beliefs about penile size.",4
Recommendations,Strength rating
Take a comprehensive medical and sexual history in every patient presenting complaining of   short penile size.,Strong
Use stretched penile length measurements (skin junction-to-glans tip or dorsally from the   pubic bone-to-glans tip) to define penile length.,Weak
Measure flaccid and erect measurements to assess penile length in detail.,Weak
Measure penile girth in every patient presenting complaining of a short penile size.,Weak
Use validated questionnaires to screen for body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) in cases of a   normal-sized penis.,Weak
"Use validated questionnaires (e.g., IIEF-15, BAPS) to assess baseline sexual function and   beliefs concerning penile size.",Weak
Refer patients with suspected BDD for mental health counselling.,Strong
