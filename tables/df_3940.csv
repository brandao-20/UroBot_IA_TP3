"4.4.3	  Specific treatment  General preventive measures are recommended for fluid intake and diet. Hyperoxaluric stone formers should   consume foods with low oxalate content, whereas hyperuricosuric stone formers benefit from daily dietary   reduction of purine. Figure 4.3 summarises the pharmacological treatment of calcium oxalate stones [597, 604,   627-630, 633, 634, 636, 640, 643-645, 649-656, 664, 666-669]. There is only low-level evidence for the efficacy   of preventing stone recurrence based on pre-treatment stone composition examination and biochemistry   measures, or on-treatment biochemistry measures [597].",
Summary of evidence,LE
Thiazide or alkaline citrates or both can reduce stone formation.,1a
Oxalate restriction is beneficial if hyperoxaluria is present.,2b
Alkaline citrates can reduce stone formation in enteric hyperoxaluria.,4
Calcium supplement can reduce stone formation in enteric hyperoxaluria.,2
A diet reduced in fat and oxalate can be beneficial in reducing stone formation.,3
Alkaline citrates and sodium bicarbonate can be used if hypocitraturia is present.,1b
Allopurinol is first-line treatment of hyperuricosuria.,1a
Febuxostat is second-line treatment of hyperuricosuria.,1b
Avoid excessive intake of animal protein in hyperuricosuria.,1b
Restricted intake of salt is beneficial if there is high urinary sodium excretion.,1b
