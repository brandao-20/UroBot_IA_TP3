"3.4.2.5	  Minimally invasive treatment  3.4.2.5.1	 Catheterisation  Intermittent self- or third-party catheterisation [225, 226] is the preferred management for neuro-urological   patients who cannot effectively empty their bladders [130]. An adequate hand function is an independent risk   factor for cessation of intermittent catheterisation (IC) [227].   Sterile IC, as originally proposed by Guttmann and Frankel [225], significantly reduces the risk of   UTI and bacteriuria [130, 228, 229], compared with clean IC introduced by Lapides, et al., [226]. However, it   has not yet been established whether or not the incidence of UTI, other complications and user satisfaction are   affected by either sterile or clean IC, coated or uncoated catheters or by any other catheter type [230].",
