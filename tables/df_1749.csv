3.16.5	  Summary of evidence and recommendations for the management of obstructive pathology of   renal duplication: ureterocele and ectopic ureter,,,,
Recommendations,,,LE,Strength rating
Ureterocele,Diagnosis,"Use ultrasound (US), radionuclide studies  (mercaptoacetyltriglycine (MAG3)/  dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA)), voiding   cystourethrography (VCUG),  magnetic resonance urography, high-resolution  magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and cystoscopy   to assess function, to detect reflux and rule out   ipsilateral compression of the lower pole and urethral   obstruction.",3,Weak
,Treatment,"Select treatment based on symptoms, function and   reflux as well on surgical and parenteral choices:   observation, endoscopic decompression, ureteral   re-implantation, partial nephroureteretomy, complete  primary reconstruction. Offer, early endoscopic   decompression to patients with an obstructing   ureterocele.",3,Weak
Ectopic ureter,Diagnosis,"Use US, DMSA scan, VCUG or MRI for a definitive   diagnosis.",3,Weak
,Treatment,"Treatment In non-functioning moieties with  recurrent infections, heminephro-ureterectomy is a   definitive solution. Ureteral reconstruction (ureteral   re-implantation/ureteroureterostomy/  ureteropyelostomy and upper pole ureterectomy) are   other therapeutic option especially in cases in which   the upper pole has function worth preserving.",3,Weak
