"3.1.5.2	  Robot-assisted kidney transplant surgery  Robot-assisted kidney transplant (RAKT) surgery using living donor kidneys has been evaluated in multi-centre   prospective non-randomised studies (using IDEAL consortium principles) [126]. Single-centre prospective non-  randomised studies are on-going addressing RAKT with use of deceased donor kidneys. Both trans- and   extra-peritoneal approaches for RAKT are described. Potential advantages of RAKT may exist (decreased post-  operative pain, incision length and lymphocele rate). Potential issues with RAKT are the exclusion of recipients   with severe atherosclerosis or third (or further) kidney transplants, a higher than expected rate of DGF and a   small number of reported early arterial thromboses despite carefully selected cases [127]. The learning curve for   RAKT has been reported to be 35 cases for experienced surgeons in a retrospective multicentre series of 187   patients undergoing RAKT [128]. Complication and DGF rates decreased significantly and plateaued after the first      20 cases. The rate of Clavien-Dindo grade III/IV complications was 14% during the first ten RAKTs, but only 3%   after this [128]. The rate of arterial graft thrombosis (1.6%) was comparable with that for open kidney transplant   (0.5 - 3.5%) [128]. A ten year single-centre retrospective analysis of 239 obese RAKT patients concluded that   RAKT can be safely performed in obese patients with minimal risk of developing a surgical site infection [129]. A   graft failure rate of 7.1% was reported during follow-up mostly due to acute rejection. Patient and graft survival   was 95% and 93% at three years, respectively [129]. Evidence is too premature to recommend RAKT outside of   appropriately mentored prospective studies.",
Summary of evidence,LE
A meta-analysis of two RCTs and 24 observational studies favoured the extra-vesical Lich-Gregoir   technique for reduced overall complications.,1a
A multi-centre prospective comparison study found the incidence of overall complications was similar   for pyelo- and uretero-ureteral anastomosis and that for both procedures no graft was lost due to   urological complications.,2b
