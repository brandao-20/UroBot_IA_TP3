Table 24: Conservative treatments for PD,
Summary of evidence,LE
Ultrasound measurement of plaque size is inaccurate and operator dependent.,3
Doppler US may be used to assess penile haemodynamic and vascular anatomy.,2a
Intracavernous injection method is superior to other methods to provide an objective assessment of   penile curvature with an erection.,4
Recommendations,Strength rating
"Take a medical and sexual history of patients with Peyronie’s disease (PD), include duration   of the disease, pain on erection, penile deformity, difficulty in vaginal/anal intromission due   to disabling deformity and erectile dysfunction (ED).",Strong
"Take a physical examination, including assessment of palpable plaques, stretched or   erect penile length, degree of curvature (self-photography, vacuum-assisted erection test   or pharmacological-induced erection) and any other related diseases (e.g., Dupuytren’s   contracture, Ledderhose disease) in patients with PD.",Strong
Use the intracavernous injection (IC) method in the diagnostic work-up of PD to provide an   objective assessment of penile curvature with an erection.,Weak
"Use the PD specific questionnaire especially in clinical trials, but mainstream usage in daily   clinical practice is not mandatory.",Weak
"Do not use ultrasound (US), computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging to   assess plaque size and deformity in routine clinical practice.",Weak
"Use penile Doppler US in the case of diagnostic evaluation of ED, to evaluate penile   haemodynamic and vascular anatomy, and to assess location and calcification of plaques,   especially prior to surgery.",Weak
