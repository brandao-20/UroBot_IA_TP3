7.5	  Summary of evidence and guidelines for follow-up and quality of life,
Summary of evidence,LE
Follow-up surveillance is important as early detection of recurrence may increase the likelihood of   curative treatment.,3
Local or regional nodal recurrences usually occur within two years of primary treatment.,3
Penile cancer has a significant impact on QoL in many ways and there remain many unmet needs to   address.,4
"There is very little data on QoL after treatment for penile cancer. In particular, there is heterogeneity   of the psychometric tools used to assess QoL outcomes and further research is needed to develop   disease-specific PROMS for penile cancer.",3
"Generally, penile-preserving surgery preserves erectile function, although glans sensation and orgasm   can be affected. Overall, partial penectomy is associated with poorer sexual outcomes.",2b
"Access to psychological support, counselling and psychosexual therapy are critical components of a   holistic and multi-disciplinary patient support service.",4
"Ideally, following nodal surgery, patients would be referred to specialist lymphoedema services for   assessment and management before any significant lymphoedema occurs.",4
"In one UK specialist penile cancer centre (referral population approximately 11 million), 5-year CSS   rates were observed to improve by up to 12-85% following centralisation.",3
