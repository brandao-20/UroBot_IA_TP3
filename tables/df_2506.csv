"7.4.3	  Immunotherapy  7.4.3.1	  Immune checkpoint inhibitors  7.4.3.1.1	 Immuno-oncology monotherapy  Immune checkpoint inhibitor with monoclonal antibodies targets and blocks the inhibitory T-cell receptor PD-1   or cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4)-signalling to restore tumour-specific T-cell immunity   [512]. Immune checkpoint inhibitor monotherapy has been investigated as second- and third-line therapy. A   phase III trial of nivolumab vs. everolimus after one or two lines of VEGF-targeted therapy for mRCC with a   clear cell component (CheckMate 025, NCT01668784) reported a longer OS, better QoL and fewer grade 3 or   4 AEs with nivolumab than with everolimus [513]. Nivolumab has superior OS to everolimus (HR: 0.73, 95%   CI: 0.57â€“0.93, p < 0.002) in VEGF-refractory RCC with a median OS of 25 months for nivolumab and 19.6   months for everolimus with a 5-year OS probability of 26% vs. 18% [514] (LE: 1b). Patients who had failed   multiple lines of VEGF-targeted therapy were included in this trial making the results broadly applicable. The   trial included 15% MSKCC poor-risk patients. There was no PFS advantage with nivolumab despite the OS   advantage. Progression-free survival does not appear to be a reliable surrogate of outcome for PD-1 therapy in   RCC. Currently PD-L1 biomarkers are not used to select patients for this therapy.",
