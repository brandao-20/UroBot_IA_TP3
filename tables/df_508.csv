Use cisplatin-containing combination chemotherapy with GC or HD-MVAC.,Strong
"In patients unfit for cisplatin but fit for carboplatin, use the combination of carboplatin and   gemcitabine.",Strong
"In patients achieving stable disease, or better, after first-line platinum-based chemotherapy,   use maintenance treatment with PD-L1 inhibitor avelumab.",Strong
First-line treatment in patients unfit for platinum-based chemotherapy,
Consider checkpoint inhibitors pembrolizumab or atezolizumab in case of high PD-L1   Weak  expression (for definitions see text).,
Second-line treatment,
"Offer checkpoint inhibitor pembrolizumab to patients progressing during, or after, platinum-  Strong  based combination chemotherapy for metastatic disease.",
Further treatment after platinum- and immunotherapy,
Offer antibody drug conjugate enfortumab vedotin as monotherapy to patients with   advanced or metastatic UC pre-treated with platinum and immunotherapy.,Strong
"Offer treatment in clinical trials testing novel drugs (e.g. sacituzumab govitecan); or in case   of patients with FGFR3 alterations, FGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors.",Strong
Evaluate for FGFR2/3 genetic alterations for the potential use of erdafitinib in patients   with locally-advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma who have progressed following   platinum-containing chemotherapy (including within 12 months of neoadjuvant or adjuvant   platinum-containing chemotherapy).,Weak
