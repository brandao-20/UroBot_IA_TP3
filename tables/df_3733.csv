Table 6.6: Risk factors for failure after urethroplasty based on multivariable Cox regression analyses,,,,,,
Summary of evidence,LE,,,,,
Staged urethroplasty for bulbar strictures and for strictures involving the bulbar urethra yields patency   rates of 33.3-90% depending upon patient and stricture characteristics and patient satisfaction is high   with all types of staged urethroplasty.,3,,,,,
Lichen sclerosus is a relative contraindication for staged urethroplasty in the literature with lower   long-term urethral patency rates of 52.2% compared to urethral patency rates of 64.3% in non-lichen   sclerosis patients.,3,,,,,
Up to 45.5% of men elect not to proceed to 2nd stage re-tubularisation after successful 1st stage.,3,,,,,
Up to 19% of men required revision of their 1st stage urethroplasty.,3,,,,,
Recommendations,Strength rating,,,,,
Offer staged urethroplasty to men with complex anterior urethral stricture disease not   suitable for single stage urethroplasty and who are fit for reconstruction.,Weak,,,,,
Do not perform staged bulbar urethroplasty for lichen sclerosis if single stage urethroplasty   is possible.,Weak,,,,,
Consider staged procedure in patients unsure about perineal urethrostomy versus urethral   reconstruction.,Weak,,,,,
Warn men that staged urethroplasty may comprise more than two stages.,Weak,,,,,
