9.2.1.5	  Counselling and outcomes assessment - Validated questionnaires  The Augmentation Phalloplasty Patient Selection and Satisfaction Inventory (APPSSI) questionnaire is a 5-item   questionnaire proposed for the assessment and counselling about penile augmentation surgical treatment   [1465]. The Beliefs about Penis Size (BAPS) is a 10-item questionnaire created for audit and outcome research   to assess menâ€™s beliefs about penile size [1464]. Both questionnaires have failed to correlate with penile size   and lack of objective validation has restricted their use.,
