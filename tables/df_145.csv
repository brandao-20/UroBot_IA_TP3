Summary of evidence and guidelines for neoadjuvant and adjuvant chemotherapy,
Summary of evidence,LE
"Results support the activity of NAC in patients with clinically involved regional LNs from penile SCC.   However, randomised studies are lacking, and substantial concerns remain regarding the selection of   patients who are best suited for a systemic therapy approach upfront.",2b
The available evidence favours a cisplatin- and taxane-based combination (doublet or triplet) as the   preferred approach.,2b
"Limited data support the use of adjuvant chemotherapy to improve OS following surgical resection.   However, it could be offered to patients with pN3 disease post-LND if NAC has not been received,   upon careful consideration of risks and benefits with the patient.",4
Recommendations,Strength rating
"Offer neoadjuvant chemotherapy using a cisplatin- and taxane-based combination to   chemotherapy-fit patients with pelvic lymph node involvement or those with extensive   inguinal involvement (cN3), in preference to up front surgery.",Weak
Offer chemotherapy as an alternative approach to upfront surgery to selected patients with   bulky mobile inguinal nodes or bilateral disease (cN2) who are candidates for cisplatin and   taxane-based chemotherapy.,Weak
"Have a balanced discussion of risks and benefits of adjuvant chemotherapy with high-risk   patients with surgically resected disease, in particular with those with pathological pelvic LN   involvement (pN3). See also section on post-operative radiotherapy.",Weak
