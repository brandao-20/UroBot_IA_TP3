"3.1.7.7	  Lymphocele  Lymphocele is a relatively common (1-26%) complication [196]. There is a significant aetiological association   with diabetes, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors (i.e. sirolimus) therapy, and acute rejection   [197]. For large and symptomatic lymphocele, laparoscopic fenestration is associated with the lowest overall   recurrence (8%) and complication (14%) rate compared to open surgery and aspiration therapy [198].   Placement of a percutaneous drain (i.e. Pig-Tail) is an option with a success rate as high as 50% [163].   Percutaneous aspiration can be performed although the recurrence rate can be as high as 95% [198], with an   increased risk of local infection (6-17%) [198]. Furthermore, sclerosant agents such as ethanol, fibrin sealant,   gentamicin, or octreotide reduce the recurrence rate compared to simple aspiration [198, 199].",
Summary of evidence,LE
Suspect urinary leakage based on the urine output and the creatinine level in the drain fluid.,3
For early and low volume urine leaks conservative management may be considered.,3
Surgical repair should be undertaken when conservative management fails or massive urine leak   occurs.,2b
