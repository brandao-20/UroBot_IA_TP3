"11.6.2.1	  Investigation of non-obstructive azoospermia  The diagnosis of NOA is based on the evidence of two consecutive semen analyses confirming azoospermia.   Causes of OA should be ruled out. Patients with NOA should undergo a comprehensive assessment to identify   genetically transmissible conditions, potential treatable causes of azoospermia, and potential health-relevant   co-morbidity (e.g., testicular cancer and hypogonadism [of any type]). A detailed medical history (e.g., history   of cryptorchidism, previous gonadotoxic treatments for cancer, etc.) and socio-demographic characteristics   [2200], along with a comprehensive physical examination should be performed in every patient to detect   conditions potentially leading to azoospermia, while ruling out co-morbidity frequently associated with   azoospermia. Non-obstructive azoospermia can be the first sign of pituitary or GCTs of the testis [2201-2203].   Patients with NOA have been shown to be at increased risk of being diagnosed with cancer [2204]. Moreover,   other systemic conditions such as MetS, T2DM, osteoporosis and CVDs have been more frequently observed   in patients with NOA compared to normozoospermic men [2205-2207]. Azoospermic men are at higher risk   of mortality [2208, 2209]. Therefore, investigation of infertile men provides an opportunity for long-term risk   stratification for other co-morbid conditions [2210].  Genetic tests should be performed in patients with NOA to detect genetic abnormalities. As   discussed (see Section 11.3), patients should undergo karyotype analysis [1805, 1806], along with a screening   of Y-chromosome micro-deletions [1855, 2211] and of the gene coding for CFTR in order to exclude   concomitant mutations, and to rule out CBAVD [1839, 1840]. Genetic counselling for eventual transmissible   and health-relevant genetic conditions should be provided to couples.",

"Patients with non-obstructive azoospermia (NOA) should undergo a comprehensive   assessment, including detailed medical history, hormonal profile and genetic tests to   investigate the underlying aetiology and associated co-morbidity. Genetic counselling   is mandatory in couples with genetic abnormalities prior to any assisted reproductive   technology protocols.",Strong
