6.2.1.3 Summary of evidence and guidelines for follow-up during active surveillance,
Summary of evidence,LE
Serial magnetic resonance imaging can improve the detection of aggressive cancers during   follow-up.,3
A progression on MRI mandates a repeat biopsy before a change in treatment strategy.,
A stationary MRI does not make repeat biopsy superfluous.,
Recommendations,Strength rating
"Base follow-up during active surveillance (AS) on a strict protocol including digital   rectal examination (at least once yearly), prostate-specific antigen (PSA) (at least   once every 6 months) and repeated biopsy every 2 to 3 years.",Strong
Perform magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and repeat biopsy if PSA is rising (PSA-  doubling time < 3 years).,Strong
"Re-classify patients with low-volume ISUP grade group 2 disease included in   AS protocols, if repeat non-MRI-based systematic biopsies performed during   monitoring reveal > 3 positive cores or maximum CI > 50%/core of ISUP 2 disease.",Weak
"Base change in treatment on biopsy progression, not on progression on MRI and/  or PSA.",Weak
Patients with a PI-RADS 1-2 findings on MRI and a low PSA density (< 0.15) may be   excepted from repeat biopsy.,Weak
Recommendations  Strength rating,
Watchful Waiting,
Manage patients with a life expectancy < 10 years by watchful waiting.   Strong,
Active surveillance (AS),
Manage patients with a life expectancy > 10 years and low-risk disease by AS.  Strong,
