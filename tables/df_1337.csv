"4.13	  Non-invasive tests in diagnosing bladder outlet obstruction in men with LUTS  4.13.1	  Prostatic configuration/intravesical prostatic protrusion  Prostatic configuration can be evaluated with TRUS, using the concept of the presumed circle area ratio   (PCAR) [108]. The PCAR evaluates how closely the transverse US image of the prostate approaches a circular   shape. The ratio tends toward one as the prostate becomes more circular. The sensitivity of PCAR was 77% for   diagnosing BPO when PCAR was > 0.8, with 75% specificity [108].  Ultrasound measurement of intravesical prostatic protrusion (IPP) assesses the distance between   the tip of the prostate median lobe and bladder neck in the midsagittal plane, using a suprapubically positioned   US scanner, with a bladder volume of 150-250 mL; grade I protrusion is 0-4.9 mm, grade II is 5-10 mm and   grade III is > 10 mm.  Intravesical prostatic protrusion correlates well with BPO (presence and severity) on urodynamic   testing, with a PPV of 94% and a NPV of 79% [109]. Intravesical prostatic protrusion may also correlate with   prostate volume, DO, bladder compliance, detrusor pressure at maximum urinary flow, BOO index and PVR,   and negatively correlates with Qmax [110]. Furthermore, IPP also appears to successfully predict the outcome   of a trial without catheter after AUR [111, 112]. However, no information with regards to intra- or inter-observer   variability and learning curve is yet available. Therefore, whilst IPP may be a feasible option to infer BPO in men   with LUTS, the role of IPP as a non-invasive alternative to PFS in the assessment of male LUTS remains under   evaluation.",
