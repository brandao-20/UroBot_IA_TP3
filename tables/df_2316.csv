Table 6.6.1:  EAU risk groups for biochemical recurrence of localised and locally-advanced prostate,,
Recommendations,Strength rating,
Offer bone protective agents to patients with mCRPC and skeletal metastases to prevent   osseous complications.,Strong,
Monitor serum calcium and offer calcium and vitamin D supplementation when prescribing   either denosumab or bisphosphonates.,Strong,
Treat painful bone metastases early on with palliative measures such as intensity-modulated   radiation therapy/volumetric arc radiation therapy plus image-guided radiation therapy and   adequate use of analgesics.,Strong,
In patients with spinal cord compression start immediate high-dose corticosteroids and   assess for spinal surgery followed by irradiation. Offer radiation therapy alone if surgery is   not appropriate.,Strong,
Definition,,
Low-risk  Intermediate-risk  High-risk,,
any PSA  PSA > 20 ng/mL   PSA 10â€“20 ng/mL   PSA < 10 ng/mL   any GS (any ISUP grade)*  Or GS > 7 (ISUP grade 4/5)  or GS 7 (ISUP grade 2/3)  and GS < 7 (ISUP grade 1)   cT3-4* or cN+**  or cT2c*  or cT2b*  and cT1-2a*,,
Localised  Locally advanced,,
Recommendations,Strength rating,
No active treatment modality has shown superiority over any other active management   options or deferred active treatment in terms of overall- and PCa-specific survival for   clinically localised low/intermediate-risk disease.,Strong,
Offer a watchful waiting policy to asymptomatic patients with clinically localised disease   and with a life expectancy < 10 years (based on co-morbidities and age).,Strong,
Inform patients that all local treatments have side effects.,Strong,
Surgical treatment,,
Radical prostatectomy can be safely delayed for at least 3 months from diagnosis in any   risk category.,Weak,
"Inform patients that no surgical approach (open-, laparoscopic- or robotic radical   prostatectomy) has clearly shown superiority in terms of functional or oncological results.",Weak,
"When a lymph node dissection (LND) is deemed necessary based on a nomogram, perform an   extended LND template for optimal staging.",Strong,
"Consider avoiding nerve-sparing surgery when there is a risk of ipsilateral extra-capsular   extension (based on cT stage, ISUP grade, magnetic resonance imaging, or with this   information combined in a nomogram).",Weak,
Do not offer neoadjuvant androgen deprivation therapy before surgery.,Strong,
Radiotherapeutic treatment,,
Offer intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) or volumetric arc radiation therapy   (VMAT) plus image-guided radiation therapy (IGRT) for definitive treatment of PCa by   external-beam radiation therapy.,Strong,
Offer moderate hypofractionation (HFX) with IMRT/VMAT plus IGRT to the prostate to   patients with localised disease (60 Gy/20 fractions in 4 weeks or 70 Gy/28 fractions in    6 weeks).,Strong,
Offer low-dose rate (LDR) brachytherapy monotherapy to patients with good urinary   function and low-risk or NCCN favourable intermediate-risk disease.,Strong,
Offer LDR or high-dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy boost combined with IMRT/VMAT plus   IGRT to patients with good urinary function and NCCN unfavourable intermediate-risk or   high-risk disease and/or locally-advanced disease.,Weak,
Active therapeutic options outside surgery or radiotherapy,,
Only offer focal therapy with high-intensity focused ultrasound or cryotherapy within a   Strong  clinical trial or prospective registry.,,
Recommendations  Strength rating,,
Low-risk disease,,
Watchful Waiting   (WW),Offer WW to patients with a life expectancy < 10 years.  Strong,
Active   surveillance (AS),Manage patients with a life expectancy > 10 years and low-risk   Strong  disease by AS.,
,Selection of patients,
,Patients with intraductal histology on biopsy should be excluded from   AS.,Strong
,Perform magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) before a confirmatory   biopsy if no MRI has been performed before the initial biopsy.,Strong
,Take both targeted biopsy (of any PI-RADS > 3 lesion) and systematic   biopsy if a confirmatory biopsy is performed.,Weak
,"If MRI is not available, per-protocol confirmatory prostate biopsies   should be performed.",Weak
,If a patient has had upfront MRI followed by systematic and targeted   biopsies there is no need for confirmatory biopsies.,Weak
