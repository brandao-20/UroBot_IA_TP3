4.1.4.2.2	 Beta-3 Agonists  Beta-3 adrenoceptors are the predominant beta receptors expressed on detrusor smooth muscle cells and   their stimulation is thought to induce detrusor relaxation. Mirabegron was the first clinically available beta-3   agonist. Vibegron is another beta-3 agonist commercially available in some countries.,
Summary of evidence,LE
"Anticholinergic drugs are effective in improving OAB symptoms, decreasing UUI episodes, decreasing   daily urgency and frequency episodes and increasing mean voided volumes, compared with placebo.",1a
"Anticholinergic drugs caused higher adverse events than placebo including dry mouth, cognitive   impairment, and constipation.",1a
Once daily (ER) formulations are associated with lower rates of adverse events compared to IR   preparations.,1b
Transdermal oxybutynin is associated with lower rates of dry mouth than oral anticholinergic drugs but   has a higher rate of withdrawal due to skin reactions.,1b
Higher doses of anticholinergic drugs are more effective to improve OAB symptoms but exhibit a   higher risk of adverse effects.,1a
No anticholinergic drug is clearly superior to another for cure or improvement of OAB/UUI.,1a
The combination of antimuscarinics plus another treatment modality was more effective than   antimuscarinics alone in improving OAB.,1a
"Adherence to anticholinergic treatment is low and decreases over time because of lack of efficacy,   adverse events and/or cost.",2a
Most patients will stop anticholinergic agents within the first three months.,2a
