"9.3.2.2	  Surgical treatment of congenital intrinsic penile shortness  Current literature reports a wide spectrum of possible surgical interventions aimed to address penile   shortness. Nonetheless, the proposed spectrum of surgical interventions starts from less invasive procedures   - such as suspensory ligament release (SLR) - to more complex genital reconstruction - such as total phallic   reconstruction (TPR) [1493, 1494]. These issues make the surgical treatment of congenital intrinsic penile   shortness a surgical challenge in urology.",
Summary of evidence,LE
Penile prosthesis implantation is not effective in increasing penile length.,3
The evidence for the use of penile disassembly manoeuvres and the sliding technique are limited.,3
Total phallic reconstruction yields to satisfactory outcomes despite the high incidence of post-  operative complications.,3
