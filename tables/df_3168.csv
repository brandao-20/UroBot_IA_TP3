"3.7.2	  Male breast cancer  In vitro and in vivo studies have clearly documented that breast cancer growth is significantly influenced by   testosterone and/or by its conversion to E2 through different mechanisms and pathways [143]. Accordingly,   the use of SERMs still represents an important therapeutic option in the management of this cancer [143].
