Summary of evidence and guidelines for pre- and post-operative radiotherapy,
Summary of evidence,LE
No contemporary data exists to support that pre-operative RT for operable MIBC increases survival.,2a
"Pre-operative RT for operable MIBC, using a dose of 45–50 Gy in fractions of 1.8–2 Gy, results in   down-staging after 4 to 6 weeks.",2
Limited evidence supports the safe use of pre- and post-operative RT in case a neobladder is planned   or in situ.,3
Limited high-quality evidence supports the use of pre-operative RT to decrease local recurrence of   MIBC after RC.,3
"Addition of adjuvant RT to chemotherapy is associated with an improvement in local relapse-free   survival following cystectomy for locally-advanced bladder cancer (pT3b–4, or node-positive).",2a
Recommendations,Strength rating
"Do not offer pre-operative radiotherapy (RT) for operable muscle-invasive bladder cancer   since it will only result in down-staging, but will not improve survival.",Strong
Do not offer pre-operative RT when subsequent radical cystectomy (RC) with urinary   diversion is planned.,Strong
"Consider offering adjuvant RT in addition to chemotherapy following RC, based on   pathologic risk (pT3b–4 or positive nodes or positive margins).",Weak
