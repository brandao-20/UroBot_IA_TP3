Summary of evidence and guidelines for robotic-assisted laparoscopic cystectomy,
Summary of evidence,LE
"Robot-assisted radical cystectomy has longer operative time (1–1.5 hours) and higher costs, but   shorter length of hospital stay (1–1.5 days) and less blood loss compared to ORC.",1
Robotic cystectomy and open cystectomy may result in similar rates of (major) complications.,2
"Most endpoints, if reported, including intermediate-term oncological endpoint and QoL, are similar for   RARC and ORC.",2
"Surgeons experience and institutional volume are considered the key factor for outcome of both   RARC and ORC, not the technique.",2
