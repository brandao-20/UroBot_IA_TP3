"5.6.6.2	  Sacral nerve stimulation (neuromodulation)  Mechanism of action: Sacral nerve stimulation (SNS) delivers low amplitude electrical impulses to the sacral   nerve roots via an electrode implanted adjacent to the third sacral nerve root and connected to an attached   pulse generator implanted in the buttocks. It works by modulating neural activity thus stabilising bladder   electrical activity through an unknown mechanism. It is a two-stage process: in the first stage, a tined lead   electrode is placed percutaneously near the S3 root and linked to an external stimulator to assess the   response. If symptoms reduced more than 50%, patients are candidates for the second stage which is the full   implant.",
