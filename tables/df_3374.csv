Table 7: Level of evidence for prognostic group and treatment,,
Prognostic group IGCCCG,Treatment,LE
Good (SGCT and NSGCT),BEP x 3 or EP x 4,1b
Intermediate (SGCT and NSGCT),BEP x 4 or VIP x 4,1b
Poor (NSGCT),BEP x 4 or VIP x 4 if favourable marker decline,1b
,Dose escalation in selected cases with inadequate serum   tumour marker decline,1b
Summary of evidence,LE,
Thromboembolic events occur more frequently in male patients with GCTs receiving chemotherapy   than in young males under chemotherapy for other cancers.,2b,
"Retrospective studies have identified multiple risk factors for the development of thromboembolic   events including increasing stage, size of retroperitoneal lymph nodes at different cut-offs, Khorana   score > 3 and indwelling vascular access device (only modifiable risk factor).",2b,
Recommendations,Strength rating,
Balance the individual patientsâ€™ potential benefits and risks of thromboprophylaxis during   first-line chemotherapy in men with metastatic germ cell tumours.,Weak,
Avoid use of central venous-access devices during first-line chemotherapy whenever   possible.,Weak,
