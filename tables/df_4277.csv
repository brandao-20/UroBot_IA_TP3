4.2.6	  Summary of evidence and recommendations for the management of ureteral trauma,
Summary of evidence,LE
The combination of pelvic fracture and visible haematuria is highly suggestive of bladder injury.,3
Cystography is the preferred diagnostic modality for non-iatrogenic bladder injury and for suspected   IBT in the post-operative setting.,3
Cystography must be performed using retrograde filling of the bladder with a minimum volume of    300-350 mL of dilute contrast material. Passive bladder filling by clamping the urinary catheter during   the excretory phase of CT or IVP is not sufficient to exclude bladder injury.,3
