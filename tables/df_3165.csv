"3.7.2	  Male breast cancer  In vitro and in vivo studies have clearly documented that breast cancer growth is significantly influenced by   testosterone and/or by its conversion to E2 through different mechanisms and pathways [143]. Accordingly,   the use of SERMs still represents an important therapeutic option in the management of this cancer [143].   No information is available on the role of testosterone therapy in patients successfully treated for male breast   cancer; therefore, treated and active male breast cancer should be recognised as absolute contraindications   for testosterone therapy.",

"Improve lifestyle and reduce weight (e.g., obesity); withdraw, when possible, concomitant   drugs that can impair testosterone production; treat co-morbidity before starting   testosterone therapy.",Weak
"Fully inform patients about expected benefits and adverse effects of any treatment option.   Select the testosterone preparation in a joint decision process, only with fully informed   patients.",Strong
The aim of testosterone therapy is to restore serum testosterone concentration to the   therapeutic range for young men.,Weak
"Use testosterone gels rather than long-acting depot administration when starting initial   treatment, so that therapy can be adjusted or stopped in the case of treatment-related   adverse effects.",Weak
