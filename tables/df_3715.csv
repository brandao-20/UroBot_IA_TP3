"6.3.5.2.1.2	Endoluminal treatment after failed urethroplasty for post-traumatic posterior stenosis  In case of a non-obliterative and short (< 1 cm) recurrence after failed urethroplasty, endoluminal treatment can   be performed [437]. Although a 1st and 2nd DVIU can be successful with a stricture-free rate of 22.9-77.3% and   0-60% respectively, three or more incisions are never successful (see supplementary Table S6.16) [437-440].   Therefore, repetitive endoluminal treatments (dilations and/or endoscopic incisions) can only be considered as   a palliative option [441].",
Summary of evidence,LE
"Female urethral stricture symptoms are long standing and non-specific, the most commonly reported   are frequency, urgency, poor flow, incomplete emptying, and urinary incontinence. It is important to   exclude FUS in female patients with LUTS.",3
Urethral dilatation alone to 24-41 Fr provides low stricture-free rates of mean 40.1% at mean follow-  up 36 (12-59) months.,3
"Isolated repeat dilatation yields patency rates of 26.6%. However, urethral dilatation followed by  ISD   or regular planned dilatation, as palliation, provides patencyrates of 97% at mean FU 6-21 months.",3
"Urethroplasty provides patency rates of 62.5-100%.  VOBMG and DOBMG reported patency rates are   92-100% and 62.5-100%, respectively.",3
Meatotomy/meatoplasty for short meatal strictures has a success rate of 97% at twelve months   follow-up.,3
