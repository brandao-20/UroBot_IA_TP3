Summary of evidence,LE
Most population-based analyses show a significantly lower CSM for patients treated with surgery   compared to non-surgical management.,3
"In AS cohorts, the growth of SRMs is low in most cases and progression to metastatic disease is rare   (1â€“2%).",3
Low-quality studies suggest higher disease recurrence rates after RFA of tumours > 3 cm and after   cryoablation of tumours > 4 cm.,3
"Low-quality studies suggest a higher local recurrence rate for TA therapies compared to PN, but   quality of data does not allow definitive conclusions.",3
