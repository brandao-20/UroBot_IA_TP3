Table 1: Epidemiology of Neuro-Urological Disorders,,
Suprapontine and pontine lesions and diseases,,
Neurological Disease,Frequency in General Population,Type and Frequency of Neuro-  Urological Symptoms
Cerebrovascular accident  (Strokes),"450 cases/100,000/yr (Europe) [11],   10% of cardiovascular mortality.","Nocturia - overactive bladder (OAB)   - urgency urinary incontinence (UUI)   - detrusor overactivity (DO), other   patterns less frequent [12]. 57-83%   of neuro-urological symptoms at   one month post-stroke, 71-80%   spontaneous recovery at six   months [13]. Persistence of urinary   incontinence (UI) correlates with   poor prognosis [14]."
"Dementias:  Alzheimer’s disease (80%),  Vascular (10%), Other (10%).",6.4% of adults > 65 yrs [15].,"OAB - UUI – DO, 25% of   incontinence in Alzheimer’s  disease, > 25% in other dementias:   Lewy body, NPH, Binswanger,   Nasu-Hakola, Pick Disease [16].   Incontinence three times more   frequent in geriatric patients with   dementia than without [17]."
"Parkinsonian syndrome (PS)  Idiopathic Parkinson’s disease   (IPD): 75-80% of PS.  Non-IPD: Parkinson’s-plus (18%):  - Multiple system atrophy (MSA),  - Progressive supranuclear palsy,  - Corticobasal degeneration,  - Dementia with Lewy bodies.  Secondary Parkinson’s (2%).",Second most prevalent   neurodegenerative disease after   Alzheimer’s disease.  Rising prevalence of IPD with age   [18].  MSA is the most frequent non-IPD   PS.,"Urinary symptoms affect 50%   at onset, with urgency and   nocturia being the most common.   Patients with urinary symptoms at   presentation have worse disease   progression in Parkinson’s disease   [19].  Infections account for a major cause   of mortality in MSA [20].  Impaired detrusor contractility with   post-void residual (PVR) > 150 mL   seems to be the urodynamic finding   distinguishing MSA from IPD [21-23]."
Brain tumours,"26.8/100,000/yr in adults (> 19 yrs),   (17.9 benign, 8.9 malignant) [24].",Incontinence occurs mainly in frontal   location (part of frontal syndrome or   isolated in frontal location) [25].
Cerebral palsy,"Cerebral palsy: 3.1-3.6/1,000 in   children aged 8 yrs [26].","46% of patients with cerebral palsy   suffer from UI, with 85% of patients   having abnormal urodynamic studies   (Neurogenic DO most common   59%). Upper tract deterioration is   rare (2.5%) [27]."
Traumatic brain injury,"235/100,000/yr [28].","44% storage dysfunction,  38% voiding dysfunction,  60% urodynamic abnormalities [29]."
Normal pressure hydrocephalus,"0.5% of the population > 60, up to   2.9% of those > 65 [30].",Classic triad of gait and cognitive   disturbance along with UI.   Incontinence affects 98-100% of   patients [30].
Lesions and diseases between caudal brainstem and sacral spinal cord,,
Spinal cord injury (SCI),Prevalence of traumatic SCI in  developed countries ranges from   280 to 906/million [31].,Neurogenic DO and detrusor   sphincter dyssynergia (DSD) (up to   95%) and detrusor underactivity (DU)   (up to 83%) depending on the level   of the lesion [32].
Spina bifida (SB),"Spina bifida 3-4/10,000  Lumbar and lumbosacral form are   the most common (60%) [33].",Bladder function is impaired in up   to 96% of SB patients [34]. Over   50% of patients are incontinent   [35]. Patients with open and closed   defects can have equally severe   neurogenic LUT dysfunction [36].
Hereditary spastic paraplegia   (HSP),"Prevalence 1.3-9/100,000 [37].","LUTS in about 75%, mainly urgency   and voiding dysfunction. Neurogenic   DO in 81% (of whom 76% with DSD)   [37]."
Lesions and diseases of the peripheral nervous system,,
Lumbar spine  Degenerative disease  Disk prolapse  Lumbar canal stenosis,"Male (5%) and female (3%) > 35 yr   have had a lumbosciatic  episode related to disc prolapse.  Incidence: approx. 5/100,000/yr  More common in females > 45 yr.","26% difficulty to void and   acontractile detrusor [38].  Detrusor underactivity (up to 83%)   [32].   Tarlov cysts: early sensation of   filling (70%), NDO (33%), urethral   instability (33%) and stress urinary   incontinence (SUI) (33%) [39]."
Iatrogenic pelvic nerve lesions,"Rectal cancer.  Cervical cancer (multimodal  therapy, radiotherapy and surgery).  Endometriosis surgery.",After abdomino-perineal resection:   50% urinary retention.  After total mesorectal excision:   10-30% voiding dysfunction [40].
Peripheral neuropathy Diabetes  Other causes of peripheral  neuropathy causing neuro-  urological symptoms: alcohol   abuse; lumbosacral zona and   genital herpes; Guillain Barré   syndrome; porphyria and   sarcoidosis.,"Worldwide, prevalence of  pharmacologically treated diabetes   8.3% [41].",Urgency/frequency +/- incontinence   [42].  Hyposensitive and detrusor  underactivity at later phase [42].
Disseminated central diseases,,
Multiple sclerosis (MS),"Prevalence: 83/100,000 in Europe   [43].","10% of MS patients present with  voiding dysfunction at disease onset,   75% of patients will develop it after   10 yrs of MS [44].  DO: 65% [44], 43% [45].  DSD: 35% [44, 45].  Detrusor underactivity: 25% [44]."
