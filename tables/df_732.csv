"2022 recommendation: Take a biopsy of the prostatic urethra in cases of bladder neck   tumour, if bladder carcinoma in situ is present or suspected, if there is positive cytology or   urinary molecular marker test without evidence of tumour in the bladder, or if abnormalities   of the prostatic urethra are visible. If biopsy is not performed during the initial procedure, it   should be completed at the time of the second resection.",Strong
"Revised 2023 recommendation: Take a biopsy of the prostatic urethra in cases of bladder   neck tumour, if there is positive cytology or urinary molecular marker test without evidence   of tumour in the bladder, or if abnormalities of the prostatic urethra are visible. If biopsy is   not performed during the initial procedure, it should be performed at the time of the second   resection.",Strong
"2022 recommendation: Take a prostatic urethral biopsy from the pre-collicular area (between   the 5 and 7 o’clock position) using a resection loop. In case any abnormal-looking areas in   the prostatic urethra are present at this time, these need to be biopsied as well.",Weak
Revised 2023 recommendation: Take a prostatic urethral biopsy from the pre-collicular area   (between the 5 and 7 o’clock position) using a resection loop.,Weak
"2022 recommendation: The TURB record must describe tumour location, appearance, size   and multifocality, all steps of the procedure, as well as extent and completeness of resection.",Weak
"Revised 2023 recommendation: The TURB record must describe tumour location,   appearance, size and multifocality, all steps of the procedure, extent, macroscopic   completeness of resection as well as any complications.",Strong

2022 recommendation: Counsel smokers with confirmed non-muscle-invasive bladder   cancer (NMIBC) to stop smoking.,Strong
Revised 2023 recommendation: Counsel smokers to stop smoking.,Strong
"2022 recommendation: In patients with tumours presumed to be at low risk and in those   with small papillary recurrences (presumably Ta LG/G1) detected more than one year after   previous TURB, offer one immediate chemotherapy instillation.",Strong
"Revised 2023 recommendation: In patients with tumours presumed to be at low risk and in   those with small papillary recurrences (presumably Ta LG/G1) detected more than one year   after previous TURB, offer one immediate single chemotherapy instillation.",Strong
New 2023 recommendation: Offer post-operative saline or water continuous irrigation of the   bladder to patients who cannot receive a single instillation of chemotherapy.,Strong
New 2023 recommendation: Patients with small recurrent low grade Ta tumours can be   effectively and safely offered office fulguration.,Strong
New 2023 recommendation: Only offer active surveillance to selected patients with presumed   low-risk tumours not amendable to endoscopic ablation.,Strong
"2022 recommendation: In patients with intermediate-risk tumours (with or without immediate   instillation), offer one-year full- dose Bacillus Calmette- Guérin (BCG) treatment (induction   plus 3-weekly instillations at 3, 6 and 12 months), or instillations of chemotherapy (the   optimal schedule is not known) for a maximum of one year.   The final choice should be made in a shared decision-making process with the patient,   reflecting his/her risk of recurrence and progression, as well as the efficacy and side effects   of each treatment modality.",Strong
"Revised 2023 recommendation: In patients with intermediate-risk tumours (with or without   immediate instillation), one-year full- dose Bacillus Calmette- Guérin (BCG) treatment   (induction plus 3-weekly instillations at 3, 6 and 12 months), or instillations of chemotherapy   (the optimal schedule is not known) for a maximum of one year is recommended. The final   choice should reflect the individual patient’s risk of recurrence and progression as well as the   efficacy and side effects of each treatment modality, in a shared decision-making process   with the patient.",Strong
"2022 recommendation: In patients with high-risk tumours, full-dose intravesical BCG for   one to 3 years (induction plus 3-weekly instillations at 3, 6, 12, 18, 24, 30 and 36 months),   is indicated. The additional beneficial effect of the second and third years of maintenance   should be weighed against its added costs, side effects and problems connected with BCG   shortages. Immediate radical cystectomy (RC) may also be discussed with the patient.",Strong
"Revised 2023 recommendation: In patients with high-risk tumours, full-dose intravesical BCG   for one to 3 years (induction plus 3-weekly instillations at 3, 6, 12, 18, 24, 30 and 36 months),   is indicated. The additional beneficial effect of the second and third years of maintenance   should be weighed against its added costs, side effects and access to BCG. Immediate   radical cystectomy (RC) may also be discussed with the patient.",Strong
2022 recommendation: In patients with very high-risk tumours discuss immediate RC. Offer   intravesical full-dose BCG instillations for one to 3 years to those who refuse or are unfit for   RC.,Strong
Revised 2023 recommendation: In patients with very high-risk tumours offer immediate RC.   Discuss intravesical full-dose BCG instillations for one to 3 years and discuss clinical trials   with those who refuse or are unfit for RC.,Strong
