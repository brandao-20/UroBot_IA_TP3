"3.7	  Congenital penile curvature  3.7.1	  Epidemiology, aetiology and pathophysiology  Congenital penile curvature presents penile bending of a normally formed penis due to corporal disproportion.  The incidence at birth is 0.6% and congenital penile curvature is caused by asymmetry of the cavernous   bodies and an orthotopic meatus [355] because of developmental arrest during embryogenesis [356]. On   the other hand, the incidence of clinically significant congenital penile curvature is much lower, because the   extent of the curvature and its associated sexual dysfunction varies widely [357]. Most of the cases are ventral   deviations (48%), followed by lateral (24%), dorsal (5%), and a combination of ventral and lateral (23%) [358].   Most ventral curvatures are associated with hypospadias due to chordee or ventral dysplasia of cavernous   bodies [359]. Similarly, dorsal curvature is mostly associated with exstrophy/epispadias complex. Congenital   penile curvature can decrease sexual quality of life in adults and successful repair can restore patientsâ€™   psychosocial and sexual wellbeing [360].",
Summary of evidence,LE
The suggested age at surgery for primary hypospadias repair is 6-18 (24) months.,3
"The therapeutic objectives are to correct the penile curvature, to form a neo-urethra of an adequate   size, to bring the new meatus to the tip of the glans, if possible, and to achieve an overall acceptable   cosmetic appearance.",4
Androgen stimulation therapy results in increased penile length and glans circumference.,1b
The complication rate is about 10% in distal and 25% in proximal hypospadias one-stage repairs.  Higher and variable rates (between 28 and 68%) can occur in two-stage repairs.,3
Sexual functions are usually well preserved but patients report high levels of perception of deformity   and social embarrassment.,2b
