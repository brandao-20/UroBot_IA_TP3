"5.6.4	  Pharmacological management  5.6.4.1	  Drugs for urgency urinary incontinence  Muscarinic receptor antagonists [607-610] and beta-3 agonist [297-299, 611-614] are currently the first-line   pharmacological treatments for UUI. The mechanism of action, efficacy, and safety and tolerability profiles of   both classes of drugs are discussed in detail in sections 5.2.3 and 5.2.4, respectively.",
Summary of evidence,LE
"Prompted voiding, either alone or as part of a behavioural modification programme, improves   continence in elderly, care-dependent people.",1b
The combination of bladder training (BT) with antimuscarinic drugs does not result in greater   improvement of UI but may improve frequency and nocturia.,1b
"There is conflicting evidence on whether the addition of BT, electrostimulation or biofeedback   increases the effectiveness of PFMT alone.",1b
Pre-operative PFMT does not confer additional benefit to men undergoing radical prostatectomy.,1b
Electrical stimulation may add benefit to PFMT up to six months.,2
Electrical stimulation may improve UI compared to sham up to six months.,2
There is limited evidence for the effectiveness of PTNS in male population.,2
There is no evidence that PTNS cures UUI in male population.,2
