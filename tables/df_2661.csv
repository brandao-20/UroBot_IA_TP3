"3.1.7.12	  Kidney stones  Urolithiasis occurs in 0.2-1.7% of recipients [218, 219]. The most frequent causes are hyper filtration, renal   tubular acidosis, recurrent UTIs, hypocitraturia, hyperuricaemia, hyperuricemia, excessive alkaline urine,   persistent tertiary hyperparathyroidism and ureteral strictures [220, 221]. Another risk factor can be urinary   anastomosis, with the lowest stone rate using Lich-Gregoir technique [219]. The most frequent clinical signs   are fever, increased serum creatinine level, decreased urine output, and haematuria. Pain is usually not referred   to due to impaired innervation. A US examination usually provides the diagnosis although a CT of the kidneys,   ureters and bladder may be needed to confirm the location and size of the stone [220]. The management   depends on the location and size of the stone, and the presence of obstruction. In case of obstructive   stones first-line treatment includes placement of a nephrostomy tube, or in some occasions a JJ-stent [222].   Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) is usually considered the first approach for stones < 15 mm with   stone-free rates varying between 40 and 80% depending on the location of the stone [222]. Ureteroscopy,   including antegrade and retrograde approaches, can be considered for stones < 20 mm, with a success rate   of up to 67% [140, 219, 223]. For larger stones (> 20 mm), percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PNL) can be offered   with high overall effective stone-free rates. In cases of large impacted stones, uretero-ureteral anastomosis,   pyelo-ureteral anastomosis, or uretero-vesical re-implantation may provide excellent results for both stone and   ureteral obstruction [219].",
