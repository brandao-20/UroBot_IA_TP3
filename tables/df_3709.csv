"6.3.5.1.3.3.2	Prostatic strictures secondary to radiation/high energy sources  Radiotherapy and high-energy modalities (cryoablation, HIFU) might provoke prostatic necrosis, sloughing   and obstruction [100]. Cases refractory to TUR and with good bladder capacity might be salvaged by   prostatectomy taking into account the morbidity associated with salvage RP (rectal injury, VUAS, incontinence)   [100, 423]. Mundy et al., treated nine patients with patency in six, (67%) and one (11%) needing an AUS for   severe incontinence [410].",
Summary of evidence,LE
Patency rates of urethroplasty for radiation-induced BMS is 80% with no significant differences   between  EPA and augmentation urethroplasty.,3
Radiation-induced BMS longer than 2-2.5 cm are rarely amenable for EPA.,3
De novo incontinence and new onset ED after urethral surgery for radiation-induced BMS are reported   in respectively 19-26% and 0-35% of cases.,3
Salvage prostatectomy can achieve patency in 67% of patients for prostatic strictures after irradiation   or high-energy treatments but morbidity is substantial.,4
