"3.4.15.6	  Open and laparoscopic/robot-assisted stone surgery  With the advances in ESWL, PNL and RIRS, very few cases of paediatric urolithiasis require open surgery. Data   extracted from the National Inpatient Sample (NIS) databases for 2001-2014 showed that in the USA incisional   procedures (mainly nephrolithotomy, pyelolithotomy and ureterotomy) were performed in 2.6% of hospitalised   patients (52% aged 15-17 years) who required surgical intervention for urinary stones [559]. Laparoscopy   for the management of paediatric renal and ureteric stones is a safe and effective procedure when specific   indications are followed. Stone free rates of 100% were reported when laparoscopic pyelolithotomy was   applied for a > 1cm single stone located in an extra-renal pelvis [560], or when laparoscopic ureterolithotomy   was applied to impacted ureteric stones > 1.5 cm, or to ureteric stones that were refractory to SWL or URS   [561]. There are extremely limited data available on efficacy and complications of robot-assisted laparoscopic   management of paediatric urolithiasis [562].",
Summary of evidence,LE
"In children, MET could increase the rate of stone expulsion, reduce the stone expulsion time, and   decrease pain episodes/analgesia demand, but it has a higher incidence of side effects.",1b
"In children, the indications for SWL, URS and PNL are similar to those in adults.",1b
Children with renal stones of a diameter up to 20 mm (~300 mm2) are ideal candidates for SWL.,1b
Ureteroscopy has become the treatment of choice for larger distal ureteral stones in children.,1a
"In children, the indications for PNL are similar to those in adults.",1a
MiniPNL is safe and effective in children.,1b
