Table 48: Typical blood gas values (adapted from Broderick et al. [1555]),,,
Source,pO2 (mmHg),pCO2 (mmHg),pH
Normal arterial blood (room air)  (similar values are found in arterial priapism),> 90,< 40,7.40
Normal mixed venous blood (room air),40,50,7.35
Ischaemic priapism (first corporal aspirate),< 30,> 60,< 7.25
Recommendations,Strength rating,,
Take a comprehensive history to establish the diagnosis which can help to determine the   priapism subtype.,Strong,,
"Include a physical examination of the genitalia, perineum and abdomen in the diagnostic   evaluation.",Strong,,
"For laboratory testing, include a full blood count, white blood cell count with blood cell   differential, platelet count and coagulation profile. Directed further laboratory testing should   be performed depending upon history and clinical and laboratory findings. In children with   priapism, perform a complete evaluation of all possible causes.",Strong,,
Perform a haemoglobinopathy screen in patients with low flow priapism who are at high risk   of sickle cell disease or thalassemia.,Strong,,
Analyse the blood gas parameters from blood aspirated from the penis to differentiate   between ischaemic and non-ischaemic priapism.,Strong,,
Perform colour duplex ultrasound of the penis and perineum before aspiration to   differentiate between ischaemic and non-ischaemic priapism.,Strong,,
"Use magnetic resonance imaging of the penis in cases of prolonged ischaemic priapism or   refractory priapism, as an adjunct to predict smooth muscle viability.",Weak,,
Perform selected pudendal arteriogram when embolisation is planned for the management   of non-ischaemic priapism.,Strong,,
