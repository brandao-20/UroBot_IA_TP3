"6.3.2.3.3	 Risk factors  There is a lot effort in identifying risk factors affecting the success rate of urethroplasties.  The evidence is not clear about age, obesity, aetiology or prior radiation or prior surgery. The only clear risk   factors in multivariate analysis are the length and the site of the stricture, success rates are better in shorter or   bulbar strictures and worse in longer or penile strictures [317, 344-346]. Patient should be informed about the   higher risk in longer and penile strictures.",
