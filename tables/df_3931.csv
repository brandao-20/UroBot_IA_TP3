3.4.8.3	  Obesity  A high BMI can pose a higher anaesthetic risk and a lower success rate after SWL and PNL and may influence   the choice of treatment [351].,
Summary of evidence,LE
"Observation is feasible in informed patients who develop no complications (infection, refractory pain,   deterioration of renal function).",1a
Medical expulsive therapy seems to be efficacious for treating patients with ureteral stones who are   amenable to conservative management. The greatest benefit might be among those with > 5 mm   (distal) stones.,1a
"Compared with SWL, URS was associated with significantly greater SFRs up to four weeks, but the   difference was not significant at three months in the included studies.",1a
"Ureteroscopy was associated with fewer retreatments and need for secondary procedures, but with a   higher need for adjunctive procedures, greater complication rates and longer hospital stay.",1a
"In the case of severe obesity, URS is a more promising therapeutic option than SWL.",2b
