"5.3.1.4	  Transurethral incision of the prostate  Mechanism of action: Transurethral incision of the prostate (TUIP) involves incising the bladder outlet without   relevant tissue removal. Transurethral incision of the prostate is conventionally performed with Collins knife   using electrocautery; however, alternative energy sources such as holmium laser may be used [350]. The   mainstay of this technique is in prostate sizes < 30 mL without a middle lobe.",
Summary of evidence,LE
Transurethral incision of the prostate shows similar efficacy and safety to M-TURP for treating   moderate-to-severe LUTS secondary to BPO in men with prostates < 30 mL.,1a
"No case of TUR-syndrome has been recorded, the risk of bleeding requiring transfusion is negligible   and retrograde ejaculation rate is significantly lower after TUIP, but the re-operation rate is higher   compared to M-TURP.",1a
"The choice between TUIP and TURP should be based primarily on prostate volume (< 30 mL and   30-80 mL suitable for TUIP and TURP, respectively).",4
