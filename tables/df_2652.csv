"3.1.7.3	  Arterial thrombosis  Transplant renal artery thrombosis is a rare complication with a prevalence ranging from 0.5-3.5% [179].   Usually, it is a consequence of a technical error during the anastomosis although other causes may be   related to both the donor and recipientâ€™s artery condition (i.e. atherosclerosis), intimal rupture during kidney   harvesting, acute rejection episodes, external compression by haematoma or lymphocele, hypercoagulative   state, severe hypotension, and toxicity of immunosuppressive agents (cyclosporine or sirolimus) [180]. The   clinical manifestations are acute reduction of urine output and the elevation of renal function tests, often   resulting in graft loss [177]. The diagnosis is obtained with eco-colour-Doppler [177]. Surgical exploration   is usually recommended to evaluate the status of the graft. In the rare event the graft appears salvageable,   a thrombectomy must be performed. In this situation, the iliac artery is clamped and an arteriotomy vs. a   dissection of the vascular anastomosis must be performed in order to remove the clot. The graft can be flushed   in-situ and re-vascularised [177]. Unfortunately, in the majority of the situations, the graft is not perfused   and therefore an allograft nephrectomy must be performed [177, 181]. Alternatively, thrombolytic agent   administration through a catheter directly into the transplant renal artery can be an efficient treatment, after the   first ten to fourteen post-transplantation days [177].",

Perform ultrasound-colour-Doppler in case of suspected graft thrombosis.,Strong
Perform surgical exploration in case of ultrasound finding of poor graft perfusion.,Strong
Perform a surgical thrombectomy in case of a salvageable graft if arterial thrombosis is   confirmed intra-operatively.,Weak
