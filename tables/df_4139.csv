"3.4.4	  Disease management  Antimicrobial therapy is recommended because clinical success is significantly more likely in women treated   with antimicrobials compared with placebo [108]. In female patients with mild to moderate symptoms,   symptomatic therapy (e.g. Ibuprofen), as an alternative to antimicrobial treatment, may be considered in   consultation with individual patients [109-112]. The choice of antimicrobial therapy should be guided by [99]:  •	  spectrum and susceptibility patterns of the aetiological pathogens;  •	  efficacy for the particular indication in clinical studies;  •	  tolerability and adverse reactions;  •	  adverse ecological effects;  •	  costs;  •	  availability.",
