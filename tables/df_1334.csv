"4.4.1	  Digital-rectal examination and prostate size evaluation  Digital-rectal examination (DRE) is the simplest way to assess prostate volume, but the correlation to prostate   volume is poor. Quality-control procedures for DRE have been described [44]. Transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) is   more accurate in determining prostate volume than DRE. There is an underestimation of prostate volume by DRE.   The underestimation increases with increasing TRUS volume, particularly where the volume is > 30 mL [45]. A   model of visual aids has been developed to help urologists estimate prostate volume more accurately [46]. One   study concluded that DRE was sufficient to discriminate between prostate volumes > or < 50 mL [47].",
Summary of evidence,LE
Frequency volume charts (FVC) and/or bladder diaries provide real-time documentation of urinary   function and reduce recall bias.,3
Three day FVCs provide reliable measurement of urinary symptoms in patients with LUTS similar to   seven days and without losing the diagnostic accuracy.,2b
