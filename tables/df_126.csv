"6.5.2.2	  Targeted therapies  Beyond chemotherapy, currently limited additional systemic options exist. Specific actionable genetic   alterations appear rare in this disease. Targeted therapy against epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) has   been tested, similar to SCCs originating from other anatomical regions.",
Summary of evidence,LE
Low-level data support the use of platinum-based chemotherapy as first-line systemic therapy in   advanced disease.,3
Effective second-line palliative chemotherapy regimens are lacking. Second-line chemotherapy in   multiple studies was associated with median OS of six months or less.,3
"Initial phase II or basket studies assessed anti-EGFR therapy or checkpoint inhibition, as monotherapy   or combination therapy, in advanced disease. Early evidence of promising clinical activity has been   reported in patients with penile cancer.",2b
