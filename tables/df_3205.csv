"10.3.4.6	  High-flow priapism in children  Non-ischaemic priapism is a rare condition, especially in children. The embarrassment that children may have   in speaking about it to their parents can lead to misdiagnosis and underestimating the prevalence of this   condition [1744]. The aetiology, clinical presentation and diagnostic and therapeutic principles are comparable   with those of arterial priapism in adults. However, some differentiating features should be noted.",
Summary of evidence,LE
Non-ischaemic priapism can cause erectile dysfunction over time and early definitive management   should be undertaken.,3
Conservative management applying ice to the perineum or site-specific perineal compression is an   option in all cases. The use of androgen deprivation therapy may enable closure of the fistula reducing   spontaneous and sleep-related erections.,3
"Selective artery embolisation, using temporary or permanent substances, has high success rates. No   definitive statement can be made on the best substance for embolisation in terms of sexual function   preservation and success rate.",3
Repeated embolisation is a reasonable option for the treatment of non-ischaemic priapism.,2b
Selective surgical ligation of the fistula should be reserved as the last treatment option when multiple   embolisations have failed.,3
