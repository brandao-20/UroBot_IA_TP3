4.1.4.2.1.4 Summary of evidence and recommendations for anticholinergic drugs,
Summary of evidence,LE
"Anticholinergic drugs are effective in improving OAB symptoms, decreasing UUI episodes, decreasing   daily urgency and frequency episodes and increasing mean voided volumes, compared with placebo.",1a
"Anticholinergic drugs caused higher adverse events than placebo including dry mouth, cognitive   impairment, and constipation.",1a
Once daily (ER) formulations are associated with lower rates of adverse events compared to IR   preparations.,1b
Transdermal oxybutynin is associated with lower rates of dry mouth than oral anticholinergic drugs but   has a higher rate of withdrawal due to skin reactions.,1b
Higher doses of anticholinergic drugs are more effective to improve OAB symptoms but exhibit a   higher risk of adverse effects.,1a
No anticholinergic drug is clearly superior to another for cure or improvement of OAB/UUI.,1a
The combination of antimuscarinics plus another treatment modality was more effective than   antimuscarinics alone in improving OAB.,1a
"Adherence to anticholinergic treatment is low and decreases over time because of lack of efficacy,   adverse events and/or cost.",2a
Most patients will stop anticholinergic agents within the first three months.,2a
Recommendations,Strength rating
Offer anticholinergic drugs to woman with overactive bladder (OAB) who fail conservative   treatment.,Strong
Consider extended-release formulations of anticholinergic drugs whenever possible.,Strong
"If an anticholinergic treatment proves ineffective, consider dose escalation, offering an   alternative anticholinergic formulation, or the use of mirabegron (alone or in combination   with an anticholinergic).",Strong
Encourage early review (of efficacy and adverse effects) of patients on anticholinergic   medication for OAB.,Strong
