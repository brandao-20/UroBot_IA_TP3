Risk Groups,Presentation,Initial treatment,Comment,Follow-up
High,"Symptomatic male   or female patients   after toilet-training   with high-grade   reflux (grades IV-V),   abnormal kidneys and   LUTD",Initial treatment is   always for LUTD with   CAP; intervention   may be considered in   cases of BT infections   or persistent reflux,Greater possibility of   earlier intervention,More aggressive   follow-up for UTI   and LUTD; full   re-evaluation after    6 months
High,"Symptomatic male   or female patients   after toilet-training   with high-grade   reflux (grade IV-V),   abnormal kidneys and   no LUTD",Intervention should be   considered,Reimplantation has   better results than   endoscopic surgery,Post-operative VCUG   on indication only;   follow-up of kidney   status until after   puberty
Moderate,"Symptomatic male   or female patients   before toilet-training,   with high-grade reflux   and abnormal kidneys",CAP is the   initial treatment.   Intervention may be   considered in cases   of BT infections or   persistent reflux,Spontaneous   resolution is higher in   males,Follow-up for UTI/   hydronephrosis; full   re-evaluation after   12-24 months
Moderate,Asymptomatic   patients (PNH or   sibling) with high-  grade reflux and   abnormal kidneys,"CAP is the   initial treatment.   Intervention may be   considered in cases   of BT, infections or   persistent reflux",,Follow-up for UTI/   hydronephrosis; full   re-evaluation after   12-24 months
Moderate,"Symptomatic male or   female patients after   toilet-training, with   high-grade reflux and   normal kidneys with   LUTD",Initial treatment is   always for LUTD with   CAP. Intervention   may be considered in   cases of BT infections   or persistent reflux,"In case of persistent   LUTD, despite   urotherapy,   intervention should   be considered. The   choice of intervention   is controversial","Follow-up for UTI and   LUTD, kidney status;   full re-evaluation after   successful urotherapy"
Moderate,"Symptomatic male   or female patients   after toilet-training   with low-grade reflux,   abnormal kidneys   with or without LUTD",Choice of treatment   is controversial.   Endoscopic treatment   may be an option.   LUTD treatment   should be given if   needed,,"Follow-up for UTI,   LUTD, and kidney   status until after   puberty"
Moderate,"All symptomatic   patients with normal   kidneys, with low-  grade reflux, with   LUTD",Initial treatment is   always for LUTD with   or without CAP,,Follow-up for UTI and   LUTD
Low,"All symptomatic   patients with normal   kidneys, with low-  grade reflux, with no   LUTD",No treatment or CAP,"If no treatment is   given, parents should   be informed about   risk of infection",Follow-up for UTI
