"3.23.2.5	  Effects on renal function  Although clinical studies in children are lacking, pneumoperitoneum may also have adverse effects on renal   blood flow [1533]. High intra-abdominal pressures and reverse Trendelenburg position may cause decreased   glomerular filtration rate and decreased urine output. One study has shown that 88% of infants and 14% of   children more than one year old develop anuria within 45 minutes after initiation of PnP with 8 mmHg [1534].   However, urine output recovers with temporary polyuria after the operation. Although the clinical relevance of   decreased urine output seems insignificant, it is important to monitor the fluid and electrolyte balance of the   children during and after laparoscopic surgery.",
