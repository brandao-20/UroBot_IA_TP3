"6.3.5.2.1.2	Endoluminal treatment after failed urethroplasty for post-traumatic posterior stenosis  In case of a non-obliterative and short (< 1 cm) recurrence after failed urethroplasty, endoluminal treatment can   be performed [437]. Although a 1st and 2nd DVIU can be successful with a stricture-free rate of 22.9-77.3% and   0-60% respectively, three or more incisions are never successful (see supplementary Table S6.16) [437-440].   Therefore, repetitive endoluminal treatments (dilations and/or endoscopic incisions) can only be considered as   a palliative option [441].",
Recommendations,Strength rating
Perform open reconstruction for post-traumatic posterior stenosis only in high-volume   centres.,Weak
Perform progressive perineal excision and primary anastomosis (EPA) for obliterative   stenosis.,Strong
Perform progressive perineal EPA for non-obliterative stenosis after failed endoluminal   treatment.,Strong
Perform a midline perineal incision to gain access to the posterior urethra.,Strong
