"6.2.6	  Disease management  Before commencing any treatment, it is essential to define the subtype of PE and discuss patientâ€™s   expectations thoroughly. Pharmacotherapy must be considered the first-line treatment for patients with lifelong   PE, whereas treating the underlying cause (e.g., ED, prostatitis, LUTS, anxiety and hyperthyroidism) must be   the initial goal for patients with acquired PE [228]. Various behavioural techniques may be beneficial in treating   variable and subjective PE [770]. Psychotherapy can also be considered for PE patients who are uncomfortable   with pharmacological therapy or in combination with pharmacological therapy [771, 772]. However, there is   weak and inconsistent evidence regarding the effectiveness of these psychosexual interventions and their long-  term outcomes in PE are unknown [773].",
