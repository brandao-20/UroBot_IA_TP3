"3.1.9	  Matching of donors and recipients  Histocompatibility antigens show remarkable polymorphism and human leukocyte antigen (HLA) matching   is still very important in kidney transplantation as transplant outcome correlates with the number of HLA   mismatches [230-233]. Human leukocyte antigen incompatibility can result in proliferation and activation of   the recipientâ€™s CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells with concomitant activation of B-cell allo-antibody production. This   may lead to cellular and humoral graft rejection. Matching should concentrate on HLA antigens, which impact   outcome. Human leukocyte antigens A, B, C as well as DR must be determined in all potential recipients and   donors according to current guidelines and national allocation rules [230-235]. Additionally, it is recommended   to determine HLA-DQ antigens of donor and recipient. Furthermore, HLA-DP antigen characterisation may be   performed, especially for sensitised recipients [230-235].",
Summary of evidence,LE
Surgery (radical prostatectomy) was the most frequently performed treatment for localised PCa after   kidney transplant.,2b
Overall oncological outcomes following PCa treatment in kidney transplant recipients were   comparable to the non-transplanted population.,2b
