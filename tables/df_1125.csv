4.2.3.4.1  Summary of evidence and recommendations for urodynamics,
Summary of evidence,LE
"Preoperative urodynamic testing in women with uncomplicated, clinically demonstrable, SUI does not   improve surgical outcome for SUI.",1b
There is no consistent correlation between urethral function tests and subsequent success or failure of   SUI surgery.,3
There is no consistent evidence that preoperative DO is associated with surgical failure of MUS in   women.,3
Recommendations,Strength rating
"Perform preoperative urodynamic tests in cases of SUI with associated storage symptoms,   cases in which the type of incontinence is unclear, cases in which voiding dysfunction is   suspected, and cases with associated pelvic organ prolapse or prior surgery for SUI.",Weak
Perform urodynamic tests if the findings may change the choice of invasive treatment.,Weak
Do not use urethral pressure profilometry or leak point pressure to grade severity of   incontinence as they are primarily tests of urethral function.,Strong
