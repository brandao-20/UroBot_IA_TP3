"6.2.2.2	  Effectiveness of dilatation compared with direct vision internal urethrotomy  A SR identified only one prospective RCT comparing dilatation with DVIU and failed to detect any differences   [196, 220]. In a small (n=56) retrospective cohort study, the three-year estimated stricture recurrence-free   survival was 35.5% and 28% for respectively balloon dilatation and DVIU (p=0.21) [221].",
Summary of evidence,LE
Permanent urethral stents have a high complications and failure rate and make subsequent   urethroplasty more challenging if they fail.,3
Stents have a higher failure rate in the penile urethra.,3
Temporary stents after DVIU (direct vision internal urethrotomy) /dilatation at the bulbar urethra prolong   time to next recurrence compared to DVIU/dilatation alone.,1b
