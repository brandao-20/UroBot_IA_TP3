3.3.7.4	  Summary of evidence and recommendations for urodynamics and uro-neurophysiological tests,
Recommendations,Strength rating
"Perform a urodynamic investigation to detect and specify lower urinary tract (dys-)function,   use same session repeat measurement as it is crucial in clinical decision making.",Strong
Non-invasive testing is mandatory before invasive urodynamics is planned.,Strong
"Use video-urodynamics for invasive urodynamics in neuro-urological patients. If this is not   available, then perform a filling cystometry continuing into a pressure flow study.",Strong
Use a physiological filling rate and body-warm saline.,Strong
