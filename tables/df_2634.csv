"3.1.2.1	  Kidney storage solutions and cold storage  There are two main sources for kidney graft injury: ischaemia (warm and cold), and reperfusion injury. The   aims of modern kidney storage solutions include: control of cell-swelling during hypothermic ischaemia;   maintenance of intra- and extra-cellular electrolyte gradient during ischaemia; buffering of acidosis; provision   of energy reserve; and minimisation of oxidative reperfusion injury. There is no agreement on which of the   mechanisms is most important for post-ischaemic renal graft function [30]. No storage solution seems to   combine all mechanisms. Previously, Euro-Collins was widely used, but is no longer recommended.",
Summary of evidence,LE
"Laparoscopic living-donor nephrectomy is associated with similar rates of graft function and rejection,   urological complications and patient and graft survival to open nephrectomy.",1a
"Measures related to analgesic requirements, pain, hospital stay, and time to return to work are   significantly better for laparoscopic procedures.",1a
