"6.2.2	  Treatment of intermediate-risk disease  When managed with non-curative intent, intermediate-risk PCa is associated with 10-year and 15-year PCSM   rates of 13.0% and 19.6%, respectively [841]. These estimates are based on systematic biopsies and may be   overestimated in the era of MRI-targeted biopsies.",
Recommendations   Strength rating,
Watchful Waiting (WW),
Offer WW to asymptomatic patients with life expectancy < 10 years.  Strong,
Radical prostatectomy (RP),
Radical prostatectomy can be safely delayed for at least 3 months.   Weak,
Offer RP to selected patients as part of potential multi-modal therapy.  Strong,
Extended pelvic lymph node dissection (ePLND),

Radiotherapeutic treatment,
Offer patients intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT)/volumetric modulated arc therapy   (VMAT) plus image-guided radiation therapy (IGRT) with 76â€“78 Gy in combination with long-  term androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) (2 to 3 years).,Strong
"Offer patients with good urinary function IMRT/VMAT plus IGRT with brachytherapy boost   (either high-dose rate or low-dose rate), in combination with long-term ADT (2 to 3 years).",Weak
Therapeutic options outside surgery or radiotherapy,
Do not offer either whole gland or focal therapy.  Strong,
"Strong  Only offer ADT monotherapy to those patients unwilling or unable to receive any form of   local treatment if they have a prostate-specific antigen (PSA)-doubling time < 12 months,   and either a PSA > 50 ng/mL or a poorly-differentiated tumour.",
