"4.1.5.1	  Complications  Early (< 1 month) complications include bleeding, infection, perinephric abscess, sepsis, urinary fistula,   hypertension, urinary extravasation, and urinoma. Delayed complications include bleeding, calculus formation,   chronic pyelonephritis, hypertension, AVF  , hydronephrosis and pseudo-aneurysms. Bleeding may be life-  threatening with elective angiographic embolisation the preferred treatment [122]. Perinephric abscess   formation is initially managed by percutaneous drainage [106].  Hypertension is rare [123, 124]. It may occur acutely because of external compression from peri-  renal haematoma (Page kidney), chronically due to compressive scar formation, or as a result of renal artery   thrombosis, segmental arterial thrombosis, renal artery stenosis (Goldblatt kidney), or AVF  . Arteriography may   be required. Treatment, including medical management, excision of the ischaemic parenchymal segment,   vascular reconstruction, or nephrectomy, is indicated if hypertension persists [121].  Arteriovenous fistulae usually present with delayed onset of significant haematuria, most often after   penetrating trauma. Percutaneous embolisation is often effective for symptomatic AVF  , but larger fistulae may   require surgery [125]. The development of pseudo-aneurysm is a rare complication following blunt trauma.",
Summary of evidence,LE
Vital signs on admission give the most reliable indication of the urgency of the situation.,3
Special consideration should be given to patients with a solitary kidney and pre-existing renal disease.,4
"Haematuria is a key finding following renal trauma; although, it may not be present in certain situations. 3",
A multiphase CT scan is the best method for the diagnosis and staging of renal injuries in   haemodynamically stable patients.,3
Haemodynamic stability is the primary criterion for selecting patients for non-operative management.,3
Ureteric stenting in stable asymptomatic Grade 4 renal injuries is not necessary.,3
"Selective angioembolisation is effective in patients with active bleeding from renal injury, without other   indications for immediate abdominal operation.",3
Renal reconstruction should be attempted if haemorrhage is controlled and there is sufficient viable   renal parenchyma.,3
Iatrogenic renal injuries are procedure-dependent (1.8-15%); the most common injuries are vascular.,3
"Limited literature exists with regard to long-term consequences of renal trauma. Current follow-up   includes physical examination, urinalysis, diagnostic imaging, serum creatinine, as well as annual blood   pressure monitoring to diagnose renovascular hypertension.",4
