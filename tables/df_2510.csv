"7.4.4.4	  Treatment of patients with rare tumours  7.4.4.4.1	 Renal medullary carcinoma  Renal medullary carcinoma is one of the most aggressive RCCs [29, 194] and most patients (~67%) will present   with metastatic disease [29, 31]. Even patients who present with seemingly localised disease may develop   macrometastases shortly thereafter, often within a few weeks.  Despite treatment, median OS is thirteen months in the most recent series [35]. Due to the   infiltrative nature and medullary epicentre of RMC, RN is favoured over PN even in very early-stage disease.   Retrospective data indicate that nephrectomy in localised disease results in superior OS (16.4 vs. 7 months)   compared with systemic chemotherapy alone, but longer survival was noted in patients who achieved an   objective response to first-line chemotherapy [35, 560]. There is currently no established role for distant   metastasectomy or nephrectomy in the presence of metastases.  Palliative radiation therapy is an option and may achieve regression in the targeted areas but it   will not prevent progression outside the radiation field [561, 562]. Renal medullary carcinoma is refractory   to monotherapies with targeted anti-angiogenic regimens including TKIs and mTOR inhibitors [35, 169]. The   mainstay systemic treatments for RMC are cytotoxic combination regimens which produce partial or complete   responses in ~29% of patients [169]. There are no prospective comparisons between different chemotherapy   regimens, but most published series used various combinations of platinum agents, taxanes, gemcitabine,   and/or anthracyclines [35, 36]. High-dose-intensity combination of MVAC has also shown efficacy against   RMC [563] although a retrospective comparison did not show superiority of MVAC over cisplatin, paclitaxel,   and gemcitabine [36]. Single-agent anti-PD-1 immune checkpoint therapy has produced responses in a few   case reports, although, as yet, insufficient data are available to determine the response rate to this approach   [561, 562]. Whenever possible, patients should be enrolled in clinical trials of novel therapeutic approaches,   particularly after failing first-line cytotoxic chemotherapy.",
