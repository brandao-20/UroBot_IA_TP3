Summary of evidence and guidelines for follow-up and quality of life,
Summary of evidence,LE
Follow-up surveillance is important as early detection of recurrence may increase the likelihood of   curative treatment.,3
Local or regional nodal recurrences usually occur within two years of primary treatment.,3
Penile cancer has a significant impact on QoL in many ways and there remain many unmet needs to   address.,4
"There is very little data on QoL after treatment for penile cancer. In particular, there is heterogeneity   of the psychometric tools used to assess QoL outcomes and further research is needed to develop   disease-specific PROMS for penile cancer.",3
"Generally, penile-preserving surgery preserves erectile function, although glans sensation and orgasm   can be affected. Overall, partial penectomy is associated with poorer sexual outcomes.",2b
"Access to psychological support, counselling and psychosexual therapy are critical components of a   holistic and multi-disciplinary patient support service.",4
"Ideally, following nodal surgery, patients would be referred to specialist lymphoedema services for   assessment and management before any significant lymphoedema occurs.",4
"In one UK specialist penile cancer centre (referral population approximately 11 million), 5-year CSS   rates were observed to improve by up to 12-85% following centralisation.",3
Recommendations,Strength rating
"Deliver penile cancer care as part of an extended multi-disciplinary team comprising of   urologists specialising in penile cancer, specialist nurses, pathologists, uro-radiologists,   nuclear medicine specialists, medical and radiation oncologists, lymphoedema therapists,   psychologists, counsellors, palliative care teams for early symptom control, reconstructive   surgeons, vascular surgeons, sex therapists.",Strong
"Follow-up men after penile cancer treatment, initially 3-monthly for two years then less   frequently to assess for recurrent disease and to offer patient support services through the   extended multi-disciplinary team. At discharge, recommend self-examination with easy   access back to the clinic as local recurrence can occur late.",Strong
Discuss the psychological impact of penile cancer and its treatments with the patient and   offer psychological support and counselling services.,Strong
"Discuss the negative impact of treatments for the primary tumour on penile appearance,   sensation, urinary and sexual function so that the patient is better prepared for the   challenges he may face.",Strong
Discuss the potential impact of lymphoedema as a consequence of inguinal and pelvic   lymph node treatment with the patient and assess patients for it at follow-up and refer to   lymphoedema therapists early.,Strong
