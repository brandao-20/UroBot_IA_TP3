3.12.7	  Summary of evidence and recommendations for the management of neurogenic bladder,,
Recommendations,LE,Strength rating
Urodynamic studies should be performed in every patient with spina bifida as well   as in every child with high suspicion of a neurogenic bladder to estimate the risk   for the upper urinary tract and to evaluate the function of the detrusor and the   sphincter.,2,Strong
"In all newborns, intermittent catheterisation (IC) should be started soon after birth.   In those with a clear underactive sphincter and no overactivity, starting IC may be   delayed. If IC is delayed, closely monitor babies for urinary tract infections, upper   tract changes (ultrasound) and the lower tract (urodynamics).",3,Strong
Start early anticholinergic medication in the newborns with suspicion of an   overactive detrusor.,2,Strong
The use of suburothelial or intradetrusoral injection of onabotulinum toxin A   is an alternative and a less invasive option in children who are refractory to   anticholinergics in contrast to bladder augmentation.,2,Strong
"Treatment of faecal incontinence is important to gain continence and independence.   Treatment should be started with mild laxatives, rectal suppositories as well as   digital stimulation. If not sufficient transanal irrigation is recommended, if not   practicable or feasible, a Malone antegrade colonic enema (MACE)/Antegrade   continence enema (ACE) stoma should be discussed.",3,Strong
"Ileal or colonic bladder augmentation is recommended in patients with therapy   resistant overactivity of the detrusor, small capacity and poor compliance, which   may cause upper tract damage and incontinence. The risk of surgical and non-  surgical complications and consequences outweigh the risk of permanent damage   of the upper urinary tract +/- incontinence due to the detrusor.",2,Strong
"In patients with a neurogenic bladder and a weak sphincter, a bladder outlet   procedure should be offered. It should be done in most patients together with a   bladder augmentation.",3,Weak
Creation of a continent cutaneous catheterisable channel should be offered to   patients who have difficulties in performing an IC through the urethra.,3,Weak
A life-long follow-up of renal and reservoir function should be available and offered   to every patient. Addressing sexuality and fertility starting before/during puberty   should be offered.,3,Weak
"Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common in children with neurogenic bladders,   however, only symptomatic UTIs should be treated.",3,Weak
