"6.5.11.2.2	 RANK ligand inhibitors  Denosumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody directed against RANKL (receptor activator of nuclear   factor Îº-B ligand), a key mediator of osteoclast formation, function, and survival. In M0 CRPC, denosumab   has been associated with increased bone-metastasis-free survival compared to placebo (median benefit:      4.2 months, HR: 0.85, p = 0.028) [1262]. This benefit did not translate into a survival difference (43.9 compared   to 44.8 months, respectively) and neither the FDA or the EMA have approved denosumab for this indication [1270].  The efficacy and safety of denosumab (n = 950) compared with zoledronic acid (n = 951) in   patients with mCRPC was assessed in a phase III trial. Denosumab was superior to zoledronic acid in delaying   or preventing SREs as shown by time to first on-study SRE (pathological fracture, radiation or surgery to   bone, or spinal cord compression) of 20.7 vs. 17.1 months, respectively (HR: 0.82, p = 0.008). Both urinary   N-telopeptide and bone-specific alkaline phosphatase were significantly suppressed in the denosumab arm   compared with the zoledronic acid arm (p < 0.0001 for both). However, these findings were not associated with   any survival benefit and in a post-hoc re-evaluation of endpoints, denosumab showed identical results when   comparing SREs and symptomatic skeletal events [1271].",
Summary of evidence,LE
First-line treatment for mCRPC will be influenced by which treatments were used when metastatic   cancer was first discovered.,4
"No clear-cut recommendation can be made for the most effective drug for first-line CRPC treatment   (i.e., hormone therapy, chemotherapy or radium-223) as no validated predictive factors exist.",3
