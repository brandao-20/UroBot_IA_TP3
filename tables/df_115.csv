Summary of evidence,LE
Penile intra-epithelial neoplasia progress to invasive lesions in 2.6–13% despite treatment.,3
"Response and recurrence rates of topical therapies for PeIN are 40–100% and 20% for IQ and   48–74% and 11% for 5-FU. For laser therapy, response rates are 52–100% and recurrence rates   7–48%. For glans resurfacing, recurrence rates are as low as 4%.",3
A SR including retrospective studies on organ-sparing surgical treatment of the primary lesion   shows that cumulative mean 5-year RFRs are 82% in case series and 76.7% in non-RCTs. For   (partial) amputative surgery these are 83.9% in case series and 93.3% in non-controlled studies. The   cumulative mean 5-year RFR was 69.4% for patients treated with laser therapy for invasive disease.,3
Current literature on frozen section analysis in organ-sparing surgery is heterogeneous and conflicting.   3,
Tumour distance to the resection margin < 1 mm resulted in higher local recurrence rates in a recent   large retrospective case series from a tertiary referral centre.,3
"Several retrospective series from claims databases and high-volume centres studying non-specified   organ-sparing surgical and ablative techniques show no impact of local recurrence on CSS where   case mix is pitched towards lower grade, lower stage tumours. However, a recent large retrospective   series of glansectomies performed in high-volume centres showed local recurrence was a predictor of   poor CSS in a cohort with a high number of T2, T3 and high-grade lesions.",3
The cumulative mean 5-year RFRs are 78.6% after brachytherapy and 55.2% after EBRT.,3
"For neo-adjuvant chemotherapy, pooled ORR was 53% (95% CI: 42–64%), the pCR rate in   prospective studies was 4–10% (95% CI: 5–30%) in a recent SR and meta-analysis.",2a
