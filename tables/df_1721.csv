Summary of evidence,LE
"Non-retractability of the foreskin, preputial adhesions and ballooning may be a physiological phase   before puberty and do not require treatment in the absence of symptoms.",3
Forced retraction of a narrow foreskin should be avoided to prevent scar formation which may result   in secondary pathological phimosis.,3
"Conservative treatment of phimosis with topical corticosteroids (ointment or cream) has a high   success rate, but surgical treatment may be considered if preferred by caregivers or patients.",1b
Balanitis xerotica obliterans warrants prolonged follow up due to risk of meatal stenosis or urethral   involvement.,2
