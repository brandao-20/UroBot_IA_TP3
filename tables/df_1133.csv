Summary of evidence,LE
Implantation of an artificial sphincter can improve or cure incontinence in women with uncomplicated   SUI.,3
Implantation of the adjustable compression therapy (ACT®) device may improve uncomplicated SUI.,3
"Complications, mechanical failure and device explantation often occur with both the artificial sphincter   and ACT©.",3
Recommendations,Strength rating
Offer mechanical devices to women with mild-to-moderate SUI who fail conservative   treatment only as part of a well-conducted research trial.,Strong
"Inform women receiving artificial urinary sphincter or adjustable compression device (ACT®)   that, although cure is possible, even in expert centres there is a high risk of complications,   mechanical failure, or a need for explantation.",Strong
Summary of evidence,LE
Failure rates of single-incision slings appear higher than with other types of MUS.,1a
The incidence of repeat surgery is higher in those women who underwent primary transobturator   compared to retropubic MUS.,1a
The five-year failure rate of Burch colposuspension appears higher than for synthetic or traditional   sling procedures.,2b
"Some studies suggest that retropubic synthetic MUS procedures appear to be more effective than   transobturator MUS for the treatment of recurrent SUI, but this is not a consistent finding in the   literature.",1a
Most procedures are less effective when used as second-line procedures.,2a
Burch colposuspension has similar short-term patient-reported or objective cure rates when   compared to TVT for treatment of recurrent SUI.,1b
Autologous sling appears superior to Burch colposuspension for treatment of recurrent SUI.,2b
