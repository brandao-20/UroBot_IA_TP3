"5.3.2.5	  Diode laser enucleation of the prostate  Mechanism of action: For prostate surgery, diode lasers with a wavelength of 940, 980, 1,318, and 1,470 nm   (depending on the semiconductor used) are marketed for vaporisation and enucleation. Only a few have been   evaluated in clinical trials [385].",
