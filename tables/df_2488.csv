5.4	  Summary of evidence and recommendations for the diagnostic assessment of RCC,
Recommendations,Strength rating
Use multi-phasic contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) of abdomen and chest for   the diagnosis and staging of renal tumours.,Strong
Omit chest CT in patients with incidentally noted cT1a disease due to the low risk of lung   metastases in this cohort.,Weak
"Use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to better evaluate venous involvement, reduce   radiation or avoid intravenous CT contrast medium.",Weak
"Use non-ionising modalities, including MRI and contrast-enhanced ultrasound, for further   characterisation of small renal masses, tumour thrombus and differentiation of unclear renal   masses, in case the results of contrast-enhanced CT are indeterminate.",Strong
Offer brain CT/MRI in metastatic patients when systemic therapy or cytoreductive   nephrectomy is considered.,Weak
Do not routinely use bone scan and/or positron-emission tomography CT for staging of   renal cell carcinoma.,Weak
Perform a renal tumour biopsy before ablative therapy and systemic therapy without   previous pathology.,Strong
Perform a percutaneous biopsy in select patients who are considering active surveillance.,Weak
Use a coaxial technique when performing a renal tumour biopsy.,Strong
Do not perform a renal tumour biopsy of cystic renal masses unless a significant solid   component is visible at imaging.,Strong
Use a core biopsy technique rather than fine needle aspiration for histological   characterisation of solid renal tumours.,Strong
