Table 3.11: Special problems in stone removal,
Calyceal diverticulum   stones,"SWL, PNL [490] (if possible) or RIRS [490, 491].  •   Can also be removed using laparoscopic retroperitoneal surgery [492, 493].  •   Patients may become asymptomatic due to stone disintegration (SWL),   •   whilst well-disintegrated stone material remains in the original position due  to narrow calyceal neck."
Horseshoe kidneys,Can be treated in line with the options described above [494].  •   Passage of fragments after SWL might be poor.  •   Acceptable SFRs (up to 76%) with low major complication rates (2.4%)   •   can be achieved with flexible ureteroscopy [495-497].
Stones in pelvic kidneys,"•   SWL, RIRS, PNL or laparoscopic surgery [498]."
Stones formed in a   continent reservoir,•  Each stone must be considered and treated individually.
Patients with obstruction of   the UPJ,"•   When outflow abnormality requires correction, stones can be removed by   PNL together with percutaneous endopyelotomy or open/laparoscopic   reconstructive surgery.  URS together with endopyelotomy with Ho:YAG laser.  •   •   Incision with an Acucise® balloon catheter might be considered, provided   the stones can be prevented from falling into the pelvic-ureteral incision   [499-502].  •   Open surgery with correction of the UPJ obstruction (pyeloplasty) and   stone removal is a feasible option [503]."
