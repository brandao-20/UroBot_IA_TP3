"3.21.2	  Disease management  3.21.2.1	  Pre-operative fasting  Pre-operative fasting has been advocated for elective surgery to avoid the complications associated with   pulmonary aspiration during induction of anaesthesia. New regimens include a 30-60 minute limitation for   clear liquids [1477, 1478] without increased risk of pulmonary aspiration [1479]. Several studies have shown   that fasting times in clinical practice often exceed the guidelines with average fasting times of 6-10 hours   [1478-1480]. Compared to adults, children have a higher metabolic rate and low glycogen stores and impaired   gluconeogenesis, which makes hypoglycaemia an important issue to consider, especially in children < 36   months old [1478]. Therefore, it is important to prevent too long fasting times. Clear-liquid carbohydrate drinks   have been proposed to reduce these fasting times [1481].",
