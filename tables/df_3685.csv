"6.2.2	  Single dilatation  6.2.2.1	  Modalities of dilatation and results  Dilatation can be done in the office, under local anaesthesia and without complex resources [223, 224]. With   dilatation, the urethral mucosa at the stricture site is stretched and the scarring is disrupted. This is opposed   to DVIU where the stricture is incised. However, both treatment modalities use the same principle to achieve   urethral patency: a breach of the urethral mucosa at the site of the stricture in which re-epithelialisation should   occur faster than wound contraction [220].",
Recommendations,Strength rating
Do not use direct vision internal urethrotomy (DVIU) for penile strictures.,Strong
Do not use DVIU/dilatation as solitary treatment for long (> 2 cm) segment strictures.,Strong
"Perform DVIU/dilatation for a primary, single, short (< 2 cm) and non-obliterative stricture at   the bulbar urethra.",Weak
"Perform DVIU/dilatation for a short, veil-like recurrent stricture after prior bulbar   urethroplasty.",Weak
Use either “hot” or “cold knife” techniques to perform DVIU depending on operator   experience and resources.,Weak
