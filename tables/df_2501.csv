7.2.5.5	  Summary of evidence and recommendations for neoadjuvant and adjuvant therapy,
Summary of evidence,LE
Deferred CN with pre-surgical sunitinib in intermediate-risk patients with cc-mRCC shows a survival   benefit in secondary endpoint analyses and selects out patients with inherent resistance to systemic   therapy.,2b
Sunitinib alone is non-inferior compared to immediate CN followed by sunitinib in patients with   MSKCC intermediate and poor risk who require systemic therapy with VEGFR-TKI.,1a
Cytoreductive nephrectomy in patients with simultaneous complete resection of a single metastasis or   oligometastases may improve survival and delay systemic therapy.,3
Patients with MSKCC or IMDC poor risk do not benefit from CN.,1a
Patients with their primary tumour in place treated with IO-based combination therapy have better   PFS and OS in exploratory subgroup analyses compared to treatment with sunitinib.,2b
