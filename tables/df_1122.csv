4.1.4.3.4.4 Summary of evidence and recommendations for cystoplasty/urinary diversion,
Summary of evidence,LE
There is limited evidence of the effectiveness of augmentation cystoplasty and urinary diversion   specifically for treatment of idiopathic OAB or UUI.,3
Augmentation cystoplasty and urinary diversion are associated with high risks of short- and long-term   severe complications.,3
The need to perform CISC following augmentation cystoplasty is common.,3
There is no evidence comparing the efficacy or adverse effects of augmentation cystoplasty to urinary   diversion.,3
Recommendations,Strength rating
Ensure patient counselling and life-long support both prior to and after major surgery as a   treatment for overactive bladder (OAB) is provided by a specialist nurse or equivalent health   care provider.,Strong
Offer augmentation cystoplasty to patients with OAB/urge urinary incontinence (UUI)   who have failed all other treatment options and have been informed about all possible   complications.,Weak
Inform patients undergoing augmentation cystoplasty of the high risk of clean intermittent   self-catheterisation (ensure they are willing and able to do so) and that they will need life-  long surveillance.,Strong
Do not offer detrusor myectomy as a treatment for UUI.,Weak
"Only offer urinary diversion to patients who have failed less-invasive therapies for the   treatment of OAB/UUI, who will accept a stoma and have been warned about the possible   small risk of malignancy.",Weak
Recommendations,Strength rating
Offer early follow-up to women who have been commenced on anticholinergic or beta-3   agonist therapy.,Strong
"Offer repeat injections of onabotulinumtoxinA, as required, to women in whom it has been   effective (refer to the manufacturerâ€™s guidance regarding the minimum timeframe for repeat   injections).",Strong
"Offer life-long surveillance to women who have a sacral nerve stimulation implant to monitor   for lead displacement, malfunction, and battery wear.",Strong
Offer cystoscopic surveillance to women with an augmentation cystoplasty due to the small   risk of malignancy.,Weak
