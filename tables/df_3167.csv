"3.7.2	  Male breast cancer  In vitro and in vivo studies have clearly documented that breast cancer growth is significantly influenced by   testosterone and/or by its conversion to E2 through different mechanisms and pathways [143]. Accordingly,   the use of SERMs still represents an important therapeutic option in the management of this cancer [143].   No information is available on the role of testosterone therapy in patients successfully treated for male breast   cancer; therefore, treated and active male breast cancer should be recognised as absolute contraindications   for testosterone therapy.",
Recommendations,Strength rating
"Fully counsel symptomatic hypogonadal men who have been surgically treated for localised   prostate cancer (PCa) and who are currently without evidence of active disease considering   testosterone therapy, emphasising the benefits and lack of sufficient safety data on long-  term follow-up.",Weak
"Restrict treatment to patients with a low risk for recurrent PCa (i.e., pre-operative PSA    < 10 ng/mL; Gleason score < 7 [International Society for Urological Pathology grade 1];    cT1-2a)* and treatment should start after at least one year follow-up with PSA level    < 0.01 ng/mL.",Weak
Advise patients that safety data on the use of testosterone therapy in men treated for breast   cancer are unknown.,Strong
Assess cardiovascular risk factors before commencing testosterone therapy.,Strong
Assess men with known cardiovascular disease (CVD) for cardiovascular symptoms before   testosterone therapy and with close clinical assessment and evaluation during treatment.,Strong
"Treat men with hypogonadism and pre-existing CVD, venous-thromboembolism or chronic   cardiac failure, who require testosterone therapy with caution, by careful clinical monitoring   and regular measurement of haematocrit (not exceeding 54%) and testosterone levels.",Weak
Exclude a family history of venous-thromboembolism before starting testosterone therapy.,Strong
"Monitor testosterone, haematocrit at three, six and twelve months after testosterone therapy   initiation, and thereafter annually. A haematocrit > 54% should require testosterone therapy   withdrawal and phlebotomy. Re-introduce testosterone therapy at a lower dose once the   haematocrit has normalised and consider switching to topical testosterone preparations.",Strong
"Evaluate patients with polycythaemia vera and those with a higher risk of developing   elevated haematocrit every three months during the first year of testosterone therapy, and at   least every six months thereafter.",Strong
"Evaluate total PSA in PCa survivors at three, six and twelve months during the first year of   testosterone therapy, and annually thereafter.",Strong
