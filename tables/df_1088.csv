"4.5.5.1.4	 Use of vaginal pessary  Intravaginal devices such as pessaries aim to relieve voiding symptoms and improve bladder emptying by   physical correction of the obstruction caused by a POP  . In a prospective study of eighteen women with grade   three or four cystocoeles and diagnosed with BOO by urodynamics (defined as PdetQmax > 25 cm H2O, Qmax   < 15 mL/s), normal voiding was noted in seventeen (94%) immediately after placement of a vaginal pessary.   No other outcomes were available in this series [535]. No long-term data are available on the use of vaginal   pessary for BOO.",
