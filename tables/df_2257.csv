6.6.1	  General guidelines recommendations for the treatment of prostate cancer,,
Recommendations for follow-up after radical prostatectomy or radiotherapy,,
,Routinely follow-up asymptomatic patients by obtaining at least a   disease-specific history andserum prostate-specific antigen (PSA)   measurement.,Strong
,"At recurrence, only perform imaging if the result will affect treatment   planning.",Strong
Life-prolonging treatments of castration-resistant disease,,
,"Ensure that testosterone levels are confirmed to be < 50 ng/dL, before   diagnosing castration-resistant PCa (CRPC).",Strong
,"Counsel, manage and treat patients with metastatic CRPC (mCRPC)   in a multidisciplinary team.",Strong
,Treat patients with mCRPC with life-prolonging agents.,Strong
,Offer mCRPC patients somatic and/or germline molecular testing   as well as testing for mismatch repair deficiencies or microsatellite   instability.,Strong
Systemic treatments of castrate-resistant disease,,
,"Base the choice of treatment on the performance status (PS), symptoms,   co-morbidities, location and extent of disease, genomic profile, patient   preference, and on previous treatment for hormone-sensitive metastatic   PCa (mHSPC) (alphabetical order: abiraterone, cabazitaxel, docetaxel,   enzalutamide, olaparib, radium-223, sipuleucel-T).",Strong
,Offer patients with mCRPC who are candidates for cytotoxic therapy   and are chemotherapy naive docetaxel with 75 mg/m2 every 3 weeks.,Strong
,"Offer patients with mCRPC and progression following docetaxel   chemotherapy further life-prolonging treatment options, which include   abiraterone, cabazitaxel, enzalutamide, radium-223 and olaparib in   case of DNA homologous recombination repair (HRR) alterations.",Strong
,"Base further treatment decisions of mCRPC on PS, previous   treatments, symptoms, co-morbidities, genomic profile, extent of   disease and patient preference.",Strong
,Offer abiraterone or enzalutamide to patients previously treated with   one or two lines of chemotherapy.,Strong
,Avoid sequencing of androgen receptor targeted agents.,Weak
,Offer chemotherapy to patients previously treated with abiraterone or   enzalutamide.,Strong
,Offer cabazitaxel to patients previously treated with docetaxel.,Strong
,Offer cabazitaxel to patients previously treated with docetaxel and   progressing within 12 months of treatment with abiraterone or   enzalutamide.,Strong
Novel agents,,
,Offer poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors to pre-treated   mCRPC patients with relevant DNA repair gene mutations.,Strong
,"Offer 177Lu-PSMA-617 to pre-treated mCRPC patients with one or   more metastatic lesions, highly expressing PSMA (exceeding the   uptake in the liver) on the diagnostic radiolabelled PSMA PET/CT scan.",Strong
Supportive care of castration-resistant disease,,
,Offer bone protective agents to patients with mCRPC and skeletal   metastases to prevent osseous complications.,Strong
,Monitor serum calcium and offer calcium and vitamin D supplementation   when prescribing either denosumab or bisphosphonates.,Strong
,Treat painful bone metastases early on with palliative measures such   as IMRT/VMAT plus IGRT and adequate use of analgesics.,Strong
,In patients with spinal cord compression start immediate high-dose   corticosteroids and assess for spinal surgery followed by irradiation.   Offer radiation therapy alone if surgery is not appropriate.,Strong
Non-metastatic castrate-resistant disease,,
"Strong  Offer apalutamide, darolutamide or enzalutamide to patients with M0   CRPC and a high risk of developing metastasis (PSA-DT < 10 months)   to prolong time to metastases and overall survival.",,
