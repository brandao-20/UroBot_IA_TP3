Recommendations,Strength rating
"Offer immediate systemic treatment with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) to palliate   symptoms and reduce the risk for potentially serious sequelae of advanced disease (spinal   cord compression, pathological fractures, ureteral obstruction) to M1 symptomatic patients.",Strong
At the start of ADT offer luteinising hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) antagonists or   orchiectomy to patients with impending clinical complications like spinal cord compression   or bladder outlet obstruction.,Strong
Offer early systemic treatment to M1 patients asymptomatic from their tumour.,Strong
Offer short-term administration of an older generation androgen receptor (AR) antagonist to   M1 patients starting LHRH agonist to reduce the risk of the ‘flare-up’ phenomenon.,Weak
Do not offer AR antagonist monotherapy to patients with M1 disease.,Strong
Discuss combination therapy including ADT plus systemic therapy with all M1 patients.,Strong
Do not offer ADT monotherapy to patients whose first presentation is M1 disease if they have   no contra-indications for combination therapy and have a sufficient life expectancy to benefit   from combination therapy (> 1 year) and are willing to accept the increased risk of side effects.,Strong
Offer ADT combined with abiraterone acetate plus prednisone or apalutamide or   enzalutamide to patients with M1 disease and who are fit for the regimen.,Strong
Offer docetaxel only in combination with ADT plus abiraterone or darolutamide to patients   with M1 disease and who are fit for docetaxel.,Strong
Offer ADT combined with non-curative prostate radiotherapy (using doses up to the   equivalent of 72 Gy in 2 Gy fractions) to patients whose first presentation is M1 disease and   who have low volume of disease by CHAARTED criteria/M1a disease.,Strong
Do not offer ADT combined with any local treatment (RT/surgery) to patients with high-volume   (CHAARTED criteria) M1 disease outside of clinical trials (except for symptom control).,Strong
Do not offer ADT combined with surgery to M1 patients outside of clinical trials.,Strong
Only offer metastasis-directed therapy to M1 patients within a clinical trial setting or well-  designed prospective cohort study.,Strong
