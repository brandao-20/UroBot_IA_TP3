5.3.2.4	  Thulium:yttrium-aluminium-garnet laser enucleation of the prostate  Mechanism of action: The Tm:YAG laser has been described in section 5.3.1.3. Enucleation using the Tm:YAG   laser includes thulium vapoenucleation of the prostate (ThuVEP) and thulium Laser enucleation of the prostate   (ThuLEP) (blunt enucleation).,
Summary of evidence,LE
"Enucleation of the prostate using the Tm:YAG laser demonstrates similar efficacy when compared to   M-TURP/bipolar transurethral (plasmakinetic) enucleation, HoLEP and B-TURP in the short-, mid-, and   long-term, respectively.",1b
"Enucleation of the prostate using the Tm:YAG laser (ThuLEP) demonstrates similar safety compared   to TURP/bipolar transurethral (plasmakinetic) enucleation, and HoLEP in the short- and mid-term,   respectively.",1b
Vapoenucleation of the prostate using a Tm:YAG laser (ThuVEP) seems to be safe in patients with   large prostates and those receiving anticoagulant or antiplatelet therapy.,2b
