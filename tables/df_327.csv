Table 2:  Chronic Primary Pelvic Pain Syndromes (the term primary can be included in any of the,
Urological Pain Syndromes,
Primary prostate   pain syndrome,"Primary prostate pain syndrome (PPPS) is the occurrence of persistent or recurrent   episodic pain (which is convincingly reproduced by prostate palpation). There is no   proven infection or other obvious local pathology. Primary prostate pain syndrome   is often associated with negative cognitive, behavioural, sexual or emotional   consequences, as well as with symptoms suggestive of lower urinary tract and sexual   dysfunction. The term “chronic prostatitis” continues to be equated with that of   PPPS. In the authors’ and others’ opinion, this is an inappropriate term, although it   is recognised that it has a long history of use. The National Institutes of Health (NIH)   consensus [15] includes infection (types I and II), which the authors feel should not   be considered under PPPS, but as specific disease-associated pelvic pain. The term   prostadynia has also been used in the past but is no longer recommended by the   expert panel. Please note that some of the authors of the IASP document disagree with   this term and suggest that CPPPS of the male is used instead of PPPS, which has been   agreed by the majority."
Primary bladder   pain syndrome,"Primary bladder pain syndrome is the occurrence of persistent or recurrent pain   perceived in the urinary bladder region, accompanied by at least one other symptom,   such as pain worsening with bladder filling and day-time and/or night-time urinary   frequency. There is no proven infection or other obvious local pathology. Primary   bladder pain syndrome is often associated with negative cognitive, behavioural, sexual   or emotional consequences, as well as with symptoms suggestive of lower urinary   tract and sexual dysfunction. PBPS is believed to represent a heterogeneous spectrum   of disorders. There may be specific types of inflammation as a feature in subsets of   patients. Localisation of the pain can be difficult by examination, and consequently,   another localising symptom is required. Cystoscopy with hydrodistension and biopsy   may be indicated to define phenotypes. Recently, ESSIC has suggested a standardised   scheme of sub-classifications [16] to acknowledge differences and make it easier to   compare various studies. Other terms that have been used include “interstitial cystitis”,   “painful bladder syndrome”, and “PBS/IC” or “BPS/IC”. These terms are no longer   recommended."
Primary scrotal   pain syndrome,"Primary scrotal pain syndrome is the occurrence of persistent or recurrent episodic   pain localised to the scrotum or the structure within it and may be associated with   symptoms suggestive of lower urinary tract or sexual dysfunction. There is no proven   infection or other obvious local pathology. Primary scrotal pain syndrome is often   associated with negative cognitive, behavioural, sexual or emotional consequences.   Primary scrotal pain syndrome is a generic term and is used when the site of the pain is   not clearly testicular or epididymal. The pain is not in the skin of the scrotum as such,   but perceived within its contents, in a similar way to idiopathic chest pain."
Primary testicular   pain syndrome,"Primary testicular pain syndrome is the occurrence of persistent or recurrent episodic   pain perceived in the testes, and may be associated with symptoms suggestive of   lower urinary tract or sexual dysfunction. There is no proven infection or other obvious   local pathology. Primary testicular pain syndrome is often associated with negative   cognitive, behavioural, sexual or emotional consequences. Previous terms have   included orchitis, orchialgia and orchiodynia. These terms are no longer recommended"
Primary epididymal   pain syndrome,"Primary epididymal pain syndrome is the occurrence of persistent or recurrent episodic   pain perceived in the epididymis, and may be associated with symptoms suggestive of   lower urinary tract or sexual dysfunction. There is no proven infection or other obvious   local pathology. Primary epididymal pain syndrome is often associated with negative   cognitive, behavioural, sexual or emotional consequences."
Primary penile    pain syndrome,"Primary penile pain syndrome is the occurrence of pain within the penis that is not   primarily in the urethra, in the absence of proven infection or other obvious local   pathology. Primary penile pain syndrome is often associated with negative cognitive,   behavioural, sexual or emotional consequences, as well as with symptoms suggestive   of lower urinary tract and sexual dysfunction."
Primary urethral   pain syndrome,"Primary urethral pain syndrome is the occurrence of chronic or recurrent episodic   pain perceived in the urethra, in the absence of proven infection or other obvious local   pathology. Primary urethral pain syndrome is often associated with negative cognitive,   behavioural, sexual or emotional consequences, as well as with symptoms suggestive   of lower urinary tract, sexual, bowel or gynaecological dysfunction. Primary urethral   pain syndrome may occur in men and women."
Post-vasectomy  scrotal pain  syndrome,"Post-vasectomy scrotal pain syndrome is a scrotal pain syndrome that follows   vasectomy. Post-vasectomy scrotal pain syndrome is often associated with negative   cognitive, behavioural, sexual or emotional consequences, as well as with symptoms   suggestive of lower urinary tract and sexual dysfunction. Post-vasectomy pain may   be as frequent as 1% following vasectomy, possibly more frequent. The mechanisms   are poorly understood and for that reason it is considered by some a special form of   primary scrotal pain syndrome."
