"9.4	  Tissue engineered grafts  9.4.1	  Cell-free tissue engineered grafts  These grafts are derived from cadaveric or animal sources (e.g., porcine small intestine submucosa [SIS],   acellular bladder matrix, acellular dermal matrix), are completely cell-free and serve as a scaffold for host cell   ingrowth [530]. The main advantage suggested for their use is the off-shelf availability [530].",
