7.1.3.4	  Summary of evidence and recommendations for radical and partial nephrectomy techniques,
Summary of evidence,LE
Laparoscopic RN has lower morbidity than open nephrectomy.,1b
Short-term oncological outcomes for T1–T2a tumours are equivalent for laparoscopic- and open RN.,2a
"Partial nephrectomy can be performed, either by open-, pure laparoscopic- or robot-assisted   approach, based on surgeon’s expertise and skills.",2b
Robot-assisted and laparoscopic PN are associated with shorter length of hospital stay and lower   blood loss compared to open PN.,2b
Partial nephrectomy is associated with a higher percentage of PSMs compared to RN.,3
"Transperitoneal and retroperitoneal laparoscopic PN do not differ in in post-operative surgical and   medical complications, PSMs, and kidney function.",2a
"Hospital volume for PN might impact on surgical complications, warm ischaemia time and surgical margins. 3",
Radical nephrectomy after PSMs can result in over-treatment in many cases.,3
