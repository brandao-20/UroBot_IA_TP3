Summary of evidence,LE,,
Single-agent VEGF-targeted therapy has been superseded by immune checkpoint-based combination   therapy.,1b,,
Pazopanib is non-inferior to sunitinib as first-line management option in mRCC.,1b,,
Cabozantinib in intermediate- and poor-risk treatment-naive ccRCC leads to better response rates   and PFS but not OS when compared to sunitinib.,2b,,
"Tivozanib has been EMA approved, but the evidence is still considered inferior over existing choices in   the first-line setting.",3,,
Single-agent VEGF-targeted therapies are preferentially recommended after first-line PD-L1-based   combinations. Re-challenge with treatments already used should be avoided.,3,,
Single-agent cabozantinib or nivolumab are superior to everolimus after one or more lines of VEGF-  targeted therapy.,1b,,
Everolimus prolongs PFS after VEGF-targeted therapy when compared to placebo. This is no longer   widely recommended before third-line therapy.,1b,,
Lenvatinib in combination with everolimus improved PFS over everolimus alone in VEGF-refractory   disease. Its role after ICIs is uncertain. There is a lack of robust data on this combination making its   recommendation challenging.,2a,,
