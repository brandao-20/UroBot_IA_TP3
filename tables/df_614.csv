"3.6.3	  Female sexuality  The most relevant publications on neurogenic female sexual dysfunction are in women with SCI and MS. After   SCI, about 65-80% of women continue to be sexually active, but to a much lesser extent than before the injury,   and about 25% report a decreased satisfaction with their sexual life [476-478]. Although sexual dysfunction is   very common in women with MS, it is still often overlooked by medical professionals [479, 480]. A vast majority   of female SB patients considered information about sexuality from their physicians insufficient [481]. Women   with SCI reported dissatisfaction with the quality and quantity of sexuality-related rehabilitation services and   were less likely to receive sexual information than men [482-484].",
