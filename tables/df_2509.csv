"7.4.4.3	  Papillary metastatic RCC  The most common non-cc subtype is papillary RCC (pRCC). There are small single-arm trials for sunitinib and   everolimus [550-554]. Both these agents have been widely given in pRCC, but more recent data suggests   cabozantinib and other combinations may be preferable [555, 556].",
Summary of evidence,LE
Both mTOR inhibitors and VEGF-targeted therapies have limited activity in non-cc-mRCC. There   is a non-significant trend for improved oncological outcomes for sunitinib over everolimus and for   cabozantinib over sunitinib.,2a
"In non-cc-mRCC, sunitinib improved PFS over everolimus in a systematic review of phase II trials and   subgroups of patients.",1a
