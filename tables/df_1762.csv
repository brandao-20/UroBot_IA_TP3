"3.22.2	  Diagnostic evaluation  Assessment of pain is the first step in pain management. Several pain assessment tools have been validated   according to the child’s age, cultural background, mental status, communication skills and physiological   reactions [1494]. Depending on the child’s age, the 0-10 Numeric Rating Scale, Faces Revised Pain Scale or   Colour Analog Scale, for example, can be used [1495]. One of the most important topics in paediatric pain   management is informing and involving the child and caregivers during this process. Patient-family-controlled-  analgesia is the preferred pain management in the hospital and at home if provided with the correct information   [1495, 1496].",
