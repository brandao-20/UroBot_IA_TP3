Summary of evidence,LE
Transurethral resection of the bladder tumour (TURB) followed by pathology investigation of the   obtained specimen(s) is an essential step in the management of NMIBC.,1
The absence of detrusor muscle in the specimen is associated with a significantly higher risk of   residual disease and tumour under-staging (with the exception of Ta LG/G1 tumours).,2b
"A second TURB can detect residual tumours and tumour under-staging, increase recurrence-free   survival, improve outcomes after BCG treatment and provide prognostic information.",2
