"3.1.4.7	  Is there a role for dopaminergic drugs, furosemide or mannitol in renal transplantation?  Low-dose dopamine (LDD) has been used in renal transplantation due to a perceived improvement in urine   output and early graft function. Use of LDD in kidney donors is outside of the scope of this section. Conflicting   results prevent a consensus statement on routine use of LDD in transplant recipients. A small (n=20) prospective   randomised cross-over study in deceased donor renal transplantation suggested significant improvements in   urine output and creatinine clearance in the first nine hours post-surgery without adverse events [98]. By contrast,   a retrospective comparison of LDD in the first twelve hours post-deceased donor renal transplantation showed   no difference in diuresis or kidney function, but those administered LDD (n=57) had increased heart rates, longer   intensive therapy unit stay and higher six-month mortality than those not treated with LDD (n=48) [99].",
Summary of evidence,LE
Prospective cohort studies demonstrated that:  •   transposition of the recipient iliac vein is an appropriate technical solution to compensate for the   short length of the renal vein in right kidney LDN (n=43);  •   the living donor right kidney renal vein can be successfully lengthened using donor gonadal vein   (n=17) or recipient saphenous vein (n=19).,3
