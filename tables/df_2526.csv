7.1.2.2.4  Summary of evidence and recommendations for the treatment of localised RCC,
Summary of evidence,LE
The oncological outcome in terms of OS following PN equals that of RN in patients with c/p T1 RCC.,1b
Retrospective studies suggest that oncological outcomes are similar following PN vs. RN in patients   with larger (> 7 cm) RCC. Post-operative complication rates are higher in PN patients.,3b
Ipsilateral adrenalectomy during RN or PN has no survival advantage in the absence of clinically   evident adrenal involvement.,3
"In patients with localised disease without radiographic evidence of LN metastases, a survival   advantage of LND in conjunction with RN is not demonstrated in RCTs.",2b
Retrospective studies suggest a clinical benefit associated with LND in high-risk patients.,2b
"In patients unfit for surgery with massive haematuria or flank pain, embolisation can be a beneficial   palliative approach.",3
Recommendations,Strength rating
Offer surgery to achieve cure in localised renal cell cancer.,Strong
Offer partial nephrectomy (PN) to patients with T1 tumours.,Strong
"Offer PN to patients with T2 tumours and a solitary kidney or chronic kidney disease, if   technically feasible.",Weak
Do not perform ipsilateral adrenalectomy if there is no clinical evidence of invasion of the   adrenal gland.,Strong
Do not offer an extended lymph node dissection to patients with organ-confined disease.,Weak
Offer embolisation to patients unfit for surgery presenting with massive haematuria or flank   pain.,Weak
