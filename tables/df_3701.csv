"6.3.5.1.2	 Endoluminal management of non-traumatic posterior urethral stenosis  6.3.5.1.2.1	Dilatation of non-traumatic posterior urethral stenosis  This can be done under loco-regional anaesthesia [375-379]. Dilatation is used for VUAS [375-380] or radiation   induced BMS [381] and in the majority of reported cases, patients were not previously treated for their stricture   (see supplementary Table S6.12). Patency rates vary widely between 0-89% [117, 375-381]. The risk of de   novo UI was low (0-11%) and no other complications were reported. It is of note that most series report on   visually controlled dilatation [375-379] in VUAS without complete obliteration.",
Summary of evidence,LE
Perineal urethrostomy provides very good short- and long-term outcomes for men with complex   urethral stricture disease.,1a
Perineal urethrostomy (PU) provides very good short and long-term outcomes for men who are unable   to have complex reconstruction due to co-morbidities.,2b
All types of PU yield equivalent very good outcomes.,4
Augmented Gil-Vernet-Blandy or “7-flap” PU yield very good outcomes in men with extension of their   urethral stricture disease into the proximal bulbar or membranous urethra.,2
“7-flap” PU yields very good results in obese men.,3
