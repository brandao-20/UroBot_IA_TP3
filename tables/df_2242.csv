"6.2.2	  Treatment of intermediate-risk disease  When managed with non-curative intent, intermediate-risk PCa is associated with 10-year and 15-year PCSM   rates of 13.0% and 19.6%, respectively [841]. These estimates are based on systematic biopsies and may be   overestimated in the era of MRI-targeted biopsies.",
Recommendations   Strength rating,
Watchful Waiting,
Manage patients with a life expectancy < 10 years by watchful waiting.   Strong,
Active surveillance (AS),
Manage patients with a life expectancy > 10 years and low-risk disease by AS.  Strong,
Selection of patients,
Patients with intraductal histology on biopsy should be excluded from AS.,Strong
Perform magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) before a confirmatory biopsy if no MRI has been   performed before the initial biopsy.,Strong
Take both targeted biopsy (of any PI-RADS > 3 lesion) and systematic biopsy if a   confirmatory biopsy is performed.,Strong
"If MRI is not available, per-protocol confirmatory prostate biopsies should be performed.",Weak
If a patient has had upfront MRI followed by systematic and targeted biopsies there is no   need for confirmatory biopsies.,Weak
Follow-up of patients,
Repeat biopsies should be performed at least once every 3 years for 10 years.   Weak,
"In case of prostate-specific antigen progression or change in digital-rectal examination or   Strong  MRI findings, do not progress to active treatment without a repeat biopsy.",
