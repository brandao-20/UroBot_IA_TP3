Table 4.1: Clinical Tumour Node Metastasis (TNM) classification of PCa [103]
T - Primary Tumour (stage based on digital rectal examination [DRE] only)
"TX   Primary tumour cannot be assessed  T0   No evidence of primary tumour  T1   Clinically inapparent tumour that is not palpable  T1a  Tumour incidental histological finding in 5% or less of tissue resected  T1b  Tumour incidental histological finding in more than 5% of tissue resected  T1c  Tumour identified by needle biopsy (e.g. because of elevated prostate-specific antigen [PSA])  T2   Tumour that is palpable and confined within the prostate  T2a  Tumour involves one half of one lobe or less  T2b  Tumour involves more than half of one lobe, but not both lobes  T2c  Tumour involves both lobes  T3   Tumour extends palpably through the prostatic capsule  T3a  Extracapsular extension (unilateral or bilateral)  T3b  Tumour invades seminal vesicle(s)  T4   Tumour is fixed or invades adjacent structures other than seminal vesicles: external sphincter, rectum,   levator muscles, and/or pelvic wall"
N - Regional (pelvic) Lymph Nodes1
NX   Regional lymph nodes cannot be assessed  N0   No regional lymph node metastasis  N1   Regional lymph node metastasis
M - Distant Metastasis2
M0   No distant metastasis  M1   Distant metastasis  M1a     Non-regional lymph node(s)  M1b     Bone(s)  M1c     Other site(s)
