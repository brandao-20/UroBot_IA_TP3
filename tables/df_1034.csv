"3.6.2	  Diagnostic accuracy  Clinical diagnosis and cystometric findings sometimes do not correlate [66, 67] and asymptomatic women   may have abnormalities on urodynamic testing. The diagnostic accuracy of urethral pressure profilometry [68]   and urethral retro-resistance pressure measurement in SUI is poor [29]. Valsalva leak point pressure did not   reliably assess UI severity in a cohort of women selected for surgical treatment of SUI [69]. Urethral pressure   reflectometry may have greater diagnostic accuracy but its clinical role remains unclear [70]. Ambulatory   urodynamics may detect unexpected physiological variance from normal more often than conventional   cystometry does, but the clinical relevance of this is also uncertain [71, 72].",
Summary of evidence,LE
Urodynamics provide comprehensive analysis of LUT function underlying different clinical conditions.,4
Most urodynamic parameters show variability within the same session and over time.,3
"Different techniques of measuring urethral function may have good testâ€“retest reliability, but do not   consistently correlate to other urodynamic tests or to the severity of UI.",3
