Summary of evidence,LE,,,,,
Surgery for PD should only be offered in patients with stable disease with functional impairment.,2b,,,,,
"In patients with concomitant PD and ED without response to medical treatment, penile prosthesis   implantation with or without additional straightening manoeuvres is the technique of choice.",2a,,,,,
"In other cases, factors such as penile length, rigidity of erection, degree of curvature, presence of   complex deformities and patient choice must be taken into account to decide on a tunical shortening   or lengthening technique.",3,,,,,
Recommendations,Strength rating,,,,,
"Perform surgery only when Peyronie’s disease (PD) has been stable for at least three   months (without pain or deformity deterioration), which is usually the case after twelve   months from the onset of symptoms, and intercourse is compromised due to the deformity.",Strong,,,,,
"Assess penile length, curvature severity, erectile function (including response to   pharmacotherapy in case of erectile dysfunction [ED]) and patient expectations prior to   surgery.",Strong,,,,,
"Use tunical shortening procedures as the first treatment option for congenital penile   curvature and for PD with adequate penile length and rigidity, less severe curvatures   and absence of complex deformities (hourglass or hinge). The type of procedure used is   dependent on surgeon and patient preference, as no procedure has proven superior to its   counterparts.",Weak,,,,,
"Use tunical lengthening procedures for patients with PD and normal erectile function,   without adequate penile length, severe curvature or presence of complex deformities   (hourglass or hinge). The type of graft used is dependent on the surgeon and patient   factors, as no graft has proven superior to its counterparts.",Weak,,,,,
"Use the sliding techniques with extreme caution, as there is a significant risk of life changing   complications (e.g., glans necrosis).",Strong,,,,,
Do not use synthetic grafts in PD reconstructive surgery.,Strong,,,,,
"Use penile prosthesis implantation, with or without any additional straightening procedures   (modelling, plication, incision or excision with or without grafting), in PD patients with ED not   responding to pharmacotherapy.",Strong,,,,,
