"3.4.10.4.2	 Stones in the lower renal pole  The stone clearance rate after SWL seems to be lower for stones in the inferior calyx than for other intra-renal   locations. Although the disintegration efficacy of SWL is not limited compared to other locations, the fragments   often remain in the calyx and cause recurrent stone formation. The reported SFR of SWL for lower pole calculi   is 25-95%. The preferential use of endoscopic procedures is supported by some current reports, even for   stones < 1 cm [204, 382, 383, 385, 389, 393, 395-407].",
Summary of evidence,LE
"It is still debatable whether renal stones should be treated, or whether annual follow-up is sufficient for   asymptomatic calyceal stones that have remained stable for six months.",4
"Although the question of whether asymptomatic calyceal stones should be treated is still unanswered,   stone growth, de novo obstruction, associated infection, and acute and/or chronic pain are indications   for treatment.",3
Percutaneous nephrolithotomy is indicated in renal stones > 2 cm as primary option.,1a
