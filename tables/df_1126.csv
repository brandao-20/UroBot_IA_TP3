4.2.4.1.3.7 Summary of evidence and recommendations for pelvic floor muscle training,
Summary of evidence,LE
"Pelvic floor muscle training is better than no treatment for improving SUI and QoL in women with SUI   and MUI across a range of outcomes, including cure rate, improvement rate, QoL, number and volume   of urine leaks and treatment satisfaction.",1a
Pelvic floor muscle training exhibits a low rate of adverse events.,1a
"Higher-intensity, supervised treatment regimens confer greater benefit in women receiving PFMT.",1a
There is no extra benefit of combining PFMT with biofeedback.,1b
Short-term benefits of intensive PFMT can be maintained in the long term.,2a
Pelvic floor muscle training in the antenatal period is associated with a reduced risk of UI in late   pregnancy and in the short term postnatally.,1a
Postpartum PFMT is effective in women with persistent UI.,1b
The benefit of postpartum PFMT in mixed populations (continent and incontinent) of women is   uncertain.,1b
Mid-urethral sling surgery is superior to PFMT in women with moderate-to-severe SUI.,1b
Pelvic floor muscle training commencing in the early postpartum period improves UI in women for up   to six months.,1b
There is conflicting evidence on whether the addition of ES increases the effectiveness of PFMT alone.,2a
"There is low to moderate certainty evidence suggesting benefit of ES in patients with SUI. In addition,   ES may be useful for learning a correct PFM contraction.",1b
Recommendations,Strength rating
"Offer supervised intensive pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT), lasting at least three months,   as first-line therapy to all women with stress urinary incontinence (SUI) or mixed urinary   incontinence (including elderly women and pre- and postnatal women).",Strong
Ensure that PFMT programmes are as intensive as possible.,Strong
Balance the efficacy and lack of adverse events from PFMT against the expected effect and   complications from invasive surgery for SUI.,Strong
"Consider electrical stimulation for treatment of SUI, or as an adjunct for teaching PFM   contraction.",Weak
