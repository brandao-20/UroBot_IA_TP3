"3.4.15.6	  Open and laparoscopic/robot-assisted stone surgery  With the advances in ESWL, PNL and RIRS, very few cases of paediatric urolithiasis require open surgery. Data   extracted from the National Inpatient Sample (NIS) databases for 2001-2014 showed that in the USA incisional   procedures (mainly nephrolithotomy, pyelolithotomy and ureterotomy) were performed in 2.6% of hospitalised   patients (52% aged 15-17 years) who required surgical intervention for urinary stones [559]. Laparoscopy   for the management of paediatric renal and ureteric stones is a safe and effective procedure when specific   indications are followed. Stone free rates of 100% were reported when laparoscopic pyelolithotomy was   applied for a > 1cm single stone located in an extra-renal pelvis [560], or when laparoscopic ureterolithotomy   was applied to impacted ureteric stones > 1.5 cm, or to ureteric stones that were refractory to SWL or URS   [561]. There are extremely limited data available on efficacy and complications of robot-assisted laparoscopic   management of paediatric urolithiasis [562].",
Recommendations,Strength rating
Offer children with single ureteral stones less than 10 mm shock wave lithotripsy (SWL) if   localisation is possible or ureteroscopy as first-line option.,Strong
Ureteroscopy is a feasible alternative for ureteral stones not amenable to SWL.,Strong
Offer children with renal stones with a diameter of up to 20 mm (~300 mm2) SWL.,Strong
Offer children with renal pelvic or calyceal stones with a diameter > 20 mm (~300 mm2)   percutaneous nephrolithotomy.,Strong
Retrograde renal surgery is a feasible alternative for renal stones smaller than 20 mm in all   locations.,Weak
