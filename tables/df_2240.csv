6.1.6	  General guidelines for the treatment of prostate cancer*,
Recommendations,Strength rating
No active treatment modality has shown superiority over any other active management   options or deferred active treatment in terms of overall- and PCa-specific survival for   clinically localised low/intermediate-risk disease.,Strong
Offer a watchful waiting policy to asymptomatic patients with clinically localised disease   and with a life expectancy < 10 years (based on co-morbidities and age).,Strong
Inform patients that all local treatments have side effects.,Strong
Surgical treatment,
Radical prostatectomy (RP) can be safely delayed for at least 3 months from diagnosis in   any risk category.,Weak
"Inform patients that no surgical approach (open-, laparoscopic- or robotic RP) has clearly   shown superiority in terms of functional or oncological results.",Weak
"When a lymph node dissection (LND) is deemed necessary based on a nomogram, perform   an extended LND template for optimal staging.",Strong
"Consider avoiding nerve-sparing surgery when there is a risk of ipsilateral extra-capsular   extension (based on cT stage, ISUP grade, magnetic resonance imaging, or with this   information combined in a nomogram).",Weak
Do not offer neoadjuvant androgen deprivation therapy before surgery.,Strong
Radiotherapeutic treatment,
Offer intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) or volumetric arc radiation therapy   (VMAT) plus image-guided radiation therapy (IGRT) for definitive treatment of PCa by   external-beam radiation therapy.,Strong
Offer moderate hypofractionation (HFX) with IMRT/VMAT plus IGRT to the prostate to   patients with localised disease (60 Gy/20 fractions in 4 weeks or 70 Gy/28 fractions in    6 weeks).,Strong
Offer low-dose rate (LDR) brachytherapy monotherapy to patients with good urinary   function and low-risk or NCCN favourable intermediate-risk disease.,Strong
Offer LDR or high-dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy boost combined with IMRT/VMAT plus   IGRT to patients with good urinary function and NCCN unfavourable intermediate-risk or   high-risk disease and/or locally-advanced disease.,Weak
Active therapeutic options outside surgery or radiotherapy,
Offer whole-gland cryotherapy and high-intensity focused ultrasound within a clinical trial   Strong  setting or well-designed prospective cohort study.,
