Table 9.1: Comparative studies of grafts vs. flaps used in urethroplasty for anterior urethral strictures,,,,,,,,
Summary of evidence,LE,,,,,,,
"After neophallic reconstruction, local tissues go through the different stages of wound healing and   stable wound healing is usually achieved after six months.",3,,,,,,,
"After two attempts, endoscopic incision is no longer successful in trans men.",3,,,,,,,
Two-stage urethroplasty for strictures at the neophallic urethra has a patency rate of 50-88% after   phalloplasty and up to 100% after metoidioplasty.,3,,,,,,,
Y-V meatoplasty for short (< 1 cm) meatal stenosis in trans women has a stricture-free rate of 85%.,3,,,,,,,
Recommendations,Strength rating,,,,,,,
Do not perform endoscopic incision or urethroplasty within six months after neophalloplasty.,Strong,,,,,,,
Do not perform more than two endoscopic incisions for strictures in trans men unless with   palliative intent.,Strong,,,,,,,
Perform staged urethroplasty for strictures at the neophallic urethra if open reconstruction is   indicated.,Weak,,,,,,,
Perform Y-V meatoplasty for short (< 1 cm) meatal stenosis in trans women if open   reconstruction is indicated.,Weak,,,,,,,

Summary of evidence,LE,,,,,,,
"Flaps have a higher urogenital morbidity, but a comparable patency rate compared to grafts.",1b,,,,,,,
Grafts have a significantly higher complication rate compared to flaps when complete tubularisation in   a single-stage approach is needed.,1b,,,,,,,
Flaps do not rely on the local vascularisation of the recipient site.,3,,,,,,,
