"6.5.11.2.2	 RANK ligand inhibitors  Denosumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody directed against RANKL (receptor activator of nuclear   factor Îº-B ligand), a key mediator of osteoclast formation, function, and survival. In M0 CRPC, denosumab   has been associated with increased bone-metastasis-free survival compared to placebo (median benefit:      4.2 months, HR: 0.85, p = 0.028) [1262]. This benefit did not translate into a survival difference (43.9 compared   to 44.8 months, respectively) and neither the FDA or the EMA have approved denosumab for this indication [1270].  The efficacy and safety of denosumab (n = 950) compared with zoledronic acid (n = 951) in   patients with mCRPC was assessed in a phase III trial. Denosumab was superior to zoledronic acid in delaying   or preventing SREs as shown by time to first on-study SRE (pathological fracture, radiation or surgery to   bone, or spinal cord compression) of 20.7 vs. 17.1 months, respectively (HR: 0.82, p = 0.008). Both urinary   N-telopeptide and bone-specific alkaline phosphatase were significantly suppressed in the denosumab arm   compared with the zoledronic acid arm (p < 0.0001 for both). However, these findings were not associated with   any survival benefit and in a post-hoc re-evaluation of endpoints, denosumab showed identical results when   comparing SREs and symptomatic skeletal events [1271].",
Recommendations,Strength rating
Offer bone protective agents to patients with mCRPC and skeletal metastases to prevent   osseous complications.,Strong
Monitor serum calcium and offer calcium and vitamin D supplementation when prescribing   either denosumab or bisphosphonates.,Strong
Treat painful bone metastases early on with palliative measures such as intensity-modulated   radiation therapy/volumetric arc radiation therapy plus image-guided radiation therapy and   adequate use of analgesics.,Strong
In patients with spinal cord compression start immediate high-dose corticosteroids and   assess for spinal surgery followed by irradiation. Offer radiation therapy alone if surgery is   not appropriate.,Strong
