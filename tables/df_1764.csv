"3.23.2.6	  Effects on neurological system  Another effect of pneumoperitoneum is increased intracranial pressure (ICP) which normalises after desufflation   of the abdomen [1535]. Trendelenburg position, high PnP and hypoventilation are additional risk factors for   increased ICP  . Laparoscopy is therefore contraindicated in patients with intracranial space occupying lesions   [1536]. Children with ventriculo-peritoneal shunts require precautions with regards to shunt drainage, however   laparoscopy is not contraindicated [1537].",
Summary of evidence,LE
Laparoscopy and robotic-assisted laparoscopic surgery can safely be performed in children,1
"The general benefits of laparoscopy are decreased pain, shorter convalescence and better cosmetics   compared to traditional open surgery.",1
"Limitations to be considered are increased operative time, smaller working space with young age,   cost, surgeon and anaesthesiologist experience.",1
Pneumoperitoneum may have physiological effects which require close monitoring during surgery and   should be taken seriously.,2
