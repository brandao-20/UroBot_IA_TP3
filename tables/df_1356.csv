"5.3.2.5	  Diode laser enucleation of the prostate  Mechanism of action: For prostate surgery, diode lasers with a wavelength of 940, 980, 1,318, and 1,470 nm   (depending on the semiconductor used) are marketed for vaporisation and enucleation. Only a few have been   evaluated in clinical trials [385].",
Summary of evidence,LE
"Laser vaporisation of the prostate using the 80-W KTP and the 120-W LBO laser (PVP) demonstrated   higher intra-operative safety with regard to haemostatic properties when compared to TURP. Peri-  operative parameters such as catheterisation time and hospital stay are in favour of PVP, whereas   operation time and risk of re-operation are in favour of TURP. Short-term results for the 80-W KTP   laser and mid-term results for the 120-W LBO laser were comparable to TURP.",1a

Laser vaporisation of the prostate using the 80-W KTP and 120-W LBO lasers seems to be safe for the   treatment of patients receiving antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy.,2
"Laser vaporisation of the prostate using the 180-W LBO laser seems to be safe for the treatment of   patients receiving antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy; however, the level of evidence available is low.",3
