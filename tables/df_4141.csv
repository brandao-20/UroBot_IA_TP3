3.5.4	  Summary of evidence and recommendations for the diagnostic evaluation and treatment of   rUTIs,
Summary of evidence,LE
"Extensive routine workup including cystoscopy, imaging, etc. has a low diagnostic yield for the   diagnosis of rUTI.",3
Increased water intake is an effective antimicrobial-sparing strategy to prevent rUTI in premenopausal   women at high risk for recurrence who drink low volumes (< 1.5 L) of fluid daily.,3
Vaginal oestrogen replacement has shown a trend towards preventing rUTI in post-menopausal   women.,1b
Immunoactive prophylaxis has been shown to be more effective than placebo in female patients with   rUTIs in several randomised trials with a good safety profile.,1a
"Probiotics containing L. rhamnosus GR-1, L. reuteri B-54 and RC-14, L. casei shirota, or L. crispatus   CTV-05 are effective for vaginal flora restoration and have shown a trend towards prevention of rUTIs.",1b
Current scientific evidence regarding the efficacy of cranberry products in the prevention of UTIs is   inconclusive.,1a
There is contradictory evidence on the efficacy of D-mannose to reduce the number of UTI episodes.,2
"Based on limited evidence intravesical GAG therapy can reduce the number of UTIs per patient per   year, and prolong the time interval between rUTI episodes.",2
A RCT demonstrated the non-inferiority of twice-daily methenamine hippurate to daily antibiotic   prophylaxis.,1b
"Both continuous low-dose antimicrobial prophylaxis and post-coital antimicrobial prophylaxis, have   been shown to reduce the rate of rUTI.",1b
"A prospective cohort study showed that intermittent self-start therapy is effective, safe and   economical in women with rUTIs.",2b
