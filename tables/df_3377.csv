Summary of evidence,LE,,,,
"In the NSGCT good-prognosis-risk group (IGCCG), BEP x 3 is superior to other chemotherapy regimens.   Toxicity is lower when treatment is delivered in five-day regimes rather than three-day regimes.",1b,,,,
In the NSGCT intermediate-prognosis-risk group (IGCCCG) BEP x 4 is the standard treatment of   choice with a five-year survival of 89% in contemporary series.,1b,,,,
"In pathological stage II NSGCT disease, RPLND performed in specialised centres without adjuvant   chemotherapy results in 73-81% of long-lasting remissions.",2b,,,,
"In patients with a poor-prognosis metastatic NSGCT (defined by IGCCCG), treatment with BEP x 4,   results in a five-year PFS of 67%. There is no advantage in OS for high-dose chemotherapy.",1b,,,,
"Patients with a poor-prognosis metastatic NSGCT and early unfavourable tumour marker decline may   benefit from intensification of treatment with dose-dense chemotherapy, with improvement of PFS   despite no benefit being observed for OS.",1b,,,,
"Following first-line BEP chemotherapy, 6-10% of NSGCT residual masses contain active cancer, 50%   have post-pubertal teratoma, and 40% comprise of necrotic-fibrotic tissue only. Figures regarding   persistence of residual active are slightly lower in post chemotherapy residual masses < 1 cm.   Currently there is no accurate prognostication method of histology.",2b,,,,
"In CS IIA/B seminoma radiotherapy and chemotherapy treatment show similar effectiveness, with a   non-significant trend towards greater efficacy of chemotherapy in CS IIB. However, risk of second   malignancies and cardiovascular events is higher after radiotherapy.",2a,,,,
"In metastatic seminoma stage > IIC, primary chemotherapy with BEP, tailored to the IGCCCG risk   group, has proven superior to Carboplatin based chemotherapy.",1b,,,,
Fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography has a high NPV in patients with post-chemotherapy   seminoma residual masses (> 3 cm) when performed more than two months after chemotherapy.,2b,,,,
