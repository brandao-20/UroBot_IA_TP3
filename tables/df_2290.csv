Summary of evidence and guidelines for follow-up during active surveillance,
Recommendations,Strength rating
"Base follow-up during active surveillance (AS) on a strict protocol including digital rectal   examination (at least once yearly), prostate-specific antigen (PSA) (at least once every    6 months) and repeated biopsy every 2 to 3 years.",Strong
Perform magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and repeat biopsy if PSA is rising (PSA-doubling   time < 3 years).,Strong
"Re-classify patients with low-volume ISUP grade group 2 disease included in AS protocols,   if repeat non-MRI-based systematic biopsies performed during monitoring reveal > 3   positive cores or maximum CI > 50%/core of ISUP 2 disease.",Weak
"Base change in treatment on biopsy progression, not on progression on MRI and/or PSA.",Weak
Patients with a PI-RADS 1-2 findings on MRI and a low PSA density (< 0.15) may be   excepted from repeat biopsy.,Weak
Recommendations   Strength rating,
Watchful Waiting,
Manage patients with a life expectancy < 10 years by watchful waiting.   Strong,
Active surveillance (AS),
Manage patients with a life expectancy > 10 years and low-risk disease by AS.  Strong,
Selection of patients,
Patients with intraductal histology on biopsy should be excluded from AS.,Strong
Perform magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) before a confirmatory biopsy if no MRI has been   performed before the initial biopsy.,Strong
Take both targeted biopsy (of any PI-RADS > 3 lesion) and systematic biopsy if a   confirmatory biopsy is performed.,Strong
"If MRI is not available, per-protocol confirmatory prostate biopsies should be performed.",Weak
If a patient has had upfront MRI followed by systematic and targeted biopsies there is no   need for confirmatory biopsies.,Weak
Follow-up of patients,
Repeat biopsies should be performed at least once every 3 years for 10 years.   Weak,
"In case of prostate-specific antigen progression or change in digital-rectal examination or   Strong  MRI findings, do not progress to active treatment without a repeat biopsy.",
