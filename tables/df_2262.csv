"In asymptomatic men with a PSA level between 3–10 ng/mL and a normal DRE, use   one of the following tools for biopsy indication:   •   risk-calculator, provided it is correctly calibrated to the population prevalence;  •  magnetic resonance imaging of the prostate",Strong

Summary of evidence,LE
"A meta-analysis of eight studies including 1,596 patients showed significantly reduced   infectious complications in patients undergoing transperineal biopsy as compared to   transrectal biopsy.",1a
A meta-analysis of eight non-RCTS reported comparable rates of post-biopsy infections in   patients undergoing transperineal biopsy irrespective if antibiotic prophylaxis was given or not.,1a
"A meta-analysis of eleven RCTs including 2,036 men showed that use of a rectal povidone-  iodine preparation before transrectal biopsy, in addition to antimicrobial prophylaxis, resulted   in a significantly lower rate of infectious complications.",1a
