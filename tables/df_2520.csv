Table 3.2: Other renal cortical tumours and recommendations for treatment (strength rating: weak),,,
Entity,Clinical relevant notes,Malignant potential,Treatment
Collecting duct   carcinoma,"Formerly bellini duct carcinoma.   No hemoglobinopathy or   SMARCB1 abnormality. Rare,   often presenting at an advanced   stage (N+ 44% and M1, 33%   at diagnosis). The HR CSS in   comparison with ccRCC is 4.49   [23, 24, 29].","High, very aggressive.   Median survival 30   months [70].",Surgery. Response to   targeted therapies is   poor [71].
Clear-cell papillary renal   cell tumour,"Patient with ACKD, 100 times   greater risk compared with   general population [24].",Indolent,"Surgery, NSS, discuss   active surveilance."
Mucinous tubular and   spindle cell carcinoma,Tumour is associated with the   loop of Henle. < 1% of renal   neoplasm. Female predilection   (3–4:1) [24].,Intermediate,"Surgery, NSS."
Tubulocystic RCC,"Rare (< 1%). Mainly men,   imaging can be Bosniak III or IV.",Low (90% indolent),"Surgery, NSS."
Eosinophilic solid and   cystic RCC (ESC RCC),Usually alteration of TCS genes.   Predominantly in adult women.   Some with TSC (tuberous   sclerosis complex) syndrome.,Rarely metastatic.,NSS.
TFE3 re-arranged RCC,Gene fusions involving TFE3 with   one of many different partner   genes. Formerly translocation   RCC (TRCC) Xp11.2. Appr. 40%   of paediatric RCC and 1.6–4% of   adult RCC [24].,Survival similar to clear   cell RCC,Surgery. Systemic   therapy in metastatic   disease.
TFEB re-arranged RCC,"Gene fusions involving the    TFEB transcription factor,   typically via a t(6;11)(p21;q12)   translocation resulting in a   MALAT1-TFEB gene fusion.   Formerly translocation RCC   t(6;11). Less common than TFE3-  re-arranged RCC. Appr. 100    cases in the literature [24].","More indolent than the   TFE3-rearranged RCC,   with fewer than 10%   of cases resulting in   patient death.",Surgery. Systemic   therapy in metastatic   disease.
ELOC (formerly TCBE1)-  mutated RCC,Twenty cases described in   literature. Typically T1.,Indolent. Only 2   metastatic cases   described.,NSS.
Fumarate hydratase-  deficient RCC,"Formerly hereditary   leiomyomatosis and RCC-  associated RCC. Alterations   in the FH gene. Autosomal   dominant. 21–30% lifetime   risk of RCC [58]. Cutanous   leiomyomas, female uterine   leiomyoma or leiomyosarcoma.   More common in males. Median   age 44 years [23, 27, 72].",Often aggressive.,Immediate surgery. No   data about treatment   of metastatic disease.   Genetic counselling   in the family. Imaging   screening in relatives   [58].
Succinate   dehydrogenase-  deficient RCC (SDH-  deficient RCC),Rare. 0.05–0.2 % of all RCCs.,A metastatic rate of   11%,"Surgery, NSS. Long-  term follow-up and   surveillance for   other SDH-deficient   neoplasms (i.e.   paraganglioma, SDH-  deficient gastrointestinal   stromal tumour, and   pituitary adenoma) is   indicated for cases   associated with   germline mutation [23]."
ALK-rearranged RCC,Gene fusions involving anaplastic   lymphoma kinase gene (ALK)   at chromosome 2p23. Appr. 40   cases described.,Low (90% indolent),"Surgery, NSS."
Metanephric tumours,"Divided into metanephric   adenoma, adenofibroma, and   metanephric stromal tumours.",Benign,NSS.
Mixed epithelial and   stromal renal tumour,It encompasses 2 benign   leasions - mixed epithelial   and stromal tumour of the   kidney (MEST) and adult cystic   nephroma. Imaging – Bosniak   type III or IIF/IV. Overwhelmingly   in women (7:1).,Benign,Active surveillance.   NSS.
Renal cysts/cystic   lesions,"Simple cysts are frequently   occurring, while occurring   septa, calcifications and solid   components require follow-up   and/or management.",Mostly benign,Treatment or follow-  up recommendation   based on Bosniak   classification.
