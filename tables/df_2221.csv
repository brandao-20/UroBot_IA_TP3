Recommendations,Strength rating
"Base follow-up during active surveillance (AS) on a strict protocol including digital   rectal examination (at least once yearly), prostate-specific antigen (PSA) (at least   once every 6 months) and repeated biopsy every 2 to 3 years.",Strong
Perform magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and repeat biopsy if PSA is rising (PSA-  doubling time < 3 years).,Strong
"Re-classify patients with low-volume ISUP grade group 2 disease included in   AS protocols, if repeat non-MRI-based systematic biopsies performed during   monitoring reveal > 3 positive cores or maximum CI > 50%/core of ISUP 2 disease.",Weak
"Base change in treatment on biopsy progression, not on progression on MRI and/  or PSA.",Weak
Patients with a PI-RADS 1-2 findings on MRI and a low PSA density (< 0.15) may be   excepted from repeat biopsy.,Weak
