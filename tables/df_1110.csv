Do not routinely use ureteric stents as prophylaxis against injury during routine   gynaecological surgery.,Strong
"Suspect ureteric injury or fistula in patients following pelvic surgery if a fluid leak or   pelvicalyceal dilatation occurs postoperatively, or if drainage fluid contains high levels of   creatinine.",Strong
"Use three-dimensional imaging techniques to diagnose and localise urinary fistulae,   particularly in cases with negative direct visual inspection or cystoscopy.",Weak
