Table 4.9: Factors predisposing to struvite stone formation,
Summary of evidence,LE
Removing the stone material as completely as possible with surgery can reduce ongoing infection.,3
Antibiotics are beneficial after complete stone removal.,3
"Ammonium chloride, 1 g, two or three times daily, can ensure urinary acidification to prevent recurrent   infection.",3
"Methionine, 200-500 mg, one to three times daily, can be used as an alternative to ammonium   chloride, to ensure urinary acidification.",3
Treatment of underlying metabolic abnormalities reduces recurrence of mixed struvite stones.,3
Urease inhibitors in case of severe infection are occasionally used (if licensed).,1b
