3.4.8.2.1  Summary of evidence and recommendations for antithrombotic therapy and stone treatment,
Summary of evidence,LE
Active surveillance is indicated in patients at high risk for thrombotic complications in the presence of   an asymptomatic calyceal stone.,4
"The temporary discontinuation, or bridging of antithrombotic therapy in high-risk patients, should be   discussed with the internist.",3
Retrograde (flexible) URS stone removal is associated with less morbidity in patients when antithrombotic   therapy cannot be discontinued.,2a
Recommendations,Strength rating
Offer active surveillance to patients at high risk of thrombotic complications in the presence   of an asymptomatic calyceal stone.,Weak
"Decide on temporary discontinuation, or bridging of antithrombotic therapy in high-risk   patients, in consultation with the internist.",Strong
Retrograde (flexible) ureteroscopy is the preferred intervention if stone removal is essential   and antithrombotic therapy cannot be discontinued since it is associated with less morbidity.,Strong
Recommendations,Strength rating
"Consider the stone composition before deciding on the method of removal, based on   patient history, former stone analysis of the patient or Hounsfield unit on unenhanced   computed tomography.",Strong
