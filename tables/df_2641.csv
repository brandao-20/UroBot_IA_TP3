Recommendations,Strength rating
"Do not base decisions on the acceptance of a donor organ on histological findings alone,   since this might lead to an unnecessary high rate of discarded grafts. Interpret histology   in context with clinical parameters of donor and recipient including perfusion parameters   where available.",Strong
"Use paraffin histology for histomorphology as it is superior to frozen sections; however, its   diagnostic value has to be balanced against a potential delay of transplantation.",Strong
Procurement biopsies should be read by a renal pathologist or a general pathologist with   specific training in kidney pathology.,Strong
