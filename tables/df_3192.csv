"9.3.2.2	  Surgical treatment of congenital intrinsic penile shortness  Current literature reports a wide spectrum of possible surgical interventions aimed to address penile   shortness. Nonetheless, the proposed spectrum of surgical interventions starts from less invasive procedures   - such as suspensory ligament release (SLR) - to more complex genital reconstruction - such as total phallic   reconstruction (TPR) [1493, 1494]. These issues make the surgical treatment of congenital intrinsic penile   shortness a surgical challenge in urology.",
Summary of evidence,LE
"Considering the wide spectrum and the complexity of surgical interventions aimed to address penile   shortness, this surgery should be reserved to high volume centres.",4
"Suspensory ligament release, ventral phalloplasty and suprapubic lipoplasty/liposuction/lipectomy   provide an objective increase in penile length.",3
"Suspensory ligament release, ventral phalloplasty and suprapubic lipoplasty/liposuction/lipectomy are   associated with a significant incidence of complications.",3
Total phallic reconstruction provides satisfactory surgical and functional outcomes in men with   micropenis.,3
