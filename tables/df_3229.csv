Primary ED (not caused by acquired organic disease or psychogenic disorder).
"Young patients with a history of pelvic or perineal trauma, who could benefit from potentially curative   revascularisation surgery or angioplasty."
"Patients with penile deformities that might require surgical correction (e.g., Peyronieâ€™s disease and congenital   penile curvature)."
Patients with complex psychiatric or psychosexual disorders.
Patients with complex endocrine disorders.
Specific tests may be indicated at the request of the patient or their partner.
"Medico-legal reasons (e.g., implantation of penile prosthesis to document end-stage ED, and sexual abuse)."
