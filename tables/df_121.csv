"6.4	  Role of multimodal chemotherapy/radiotherapy in the management of (regional)   lymph nodes  6.4.1	  Systemic therapy  6.4.1.1	  Neoadjuvant chemotherapy  Bulky inguinal LN enlargement indicates extensive lymphatic metastatic disease for which few patients will   benefit from surgery alone. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy before inguinal LN surgery allows for early treatment of   systemic disease and down-sizing of the inguinal LN metastases. In responders, complete surgical treatment is   possible with reasonable clinical outcome.",
