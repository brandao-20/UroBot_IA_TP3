"5.2	  Pharmacological treatment  5.2.1	  Alpha 1-Adrenoceptor antagonists (α1-blockers)  Mechanism of action: Alpha 1-blockers aim to inhibit the effect of endogenously released noradrenaline on   smooth muscle cells in the prostate and thereby reduce prostate tone and BOO [143]. However, α1-blockers have   little effect on urodynamically determined bladder outlet resistance [144], and treatment-associated improvement   of LUTS correlates poorly with obstruction [145]. Thus, other mechanisms of action may also be relevant.  Alpha 1-adrenoceptors located outside the prostate (e.g. urinary bladder and/or spinal cord)   and α1-adrenoceptor subtypes (α1B- or α1D-adrenoceptors) may play a role as mediators of effects. Alpha   1-adrenoceptors in blood vessels, other non-prostatic smooth muscle cells, and the central nervous system   may mediate adverse events.  Currently available α1-blockers are: alfuzosin hydrochloride (alfuzosin); doxazosin mesylate   (doxazosin); silodosin; tamsulosin hydrochloride (tamsulosin); terazosin hydrochloride (terazosin); and   naftopidil. Alpha 1-blockers exist in different formulations. Although different formulations result in different   pharmacokinetic and tolerability profiles, the overall difference in clinical efficacy between the difference   formulations seems negligible.",
Summary of evidence,LE
"Long-term data (four years) from the MTOPS and CombAT studies showed that combination treatment   is superior to monotherapy for symptoms and Qmax, and superior to α1-blocker alone in reducing the   risk of AUR or need for surgery.",1b
The MTOPS study found that the risk of long-term clinical progression (primarily due to increasing   IPSS) was reduced by 66% with combined therapy vs. placebo and to a greater extent than with either   finasteride or doxazosin monotherapy.,1b
"The CombAT study found that combination therapy reduced the relative risks of AUR by 68%,    BPH-related surgery by 71%, and symptom deterioration by 41% compared with tamsulosin, after   four years.",1b
Adverse events of both drug classes are seen with combined treatment using α1-blockers and 5-ARIs.,1b
