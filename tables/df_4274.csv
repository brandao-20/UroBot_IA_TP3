"4.1.5.1	  Complications  Early (< 1 month) complications include bleeding, infection, perinephric abscess, sepsis, urinary fistula,   hypertension, urinary extravasation, and urinoma. Delayed complications include bleeding, calculus formation,   chronic pyelonephritis, hypertension, AVF  , hydronephrosis and pseudo-aneurysms. Bleeding may be life-  threatening with elective angiographic embolisation the preferred treatment [122]. Perinephric abscess   formation is initially managed by percutaneous drainage [106].  Hypertension is rare [123, 124]. It may occur acutely because of external compression from peri-  renal haematoma (Page kidney), chronically due to compressive scar formation, or as a result of renal artery   thrombosis, segmental arterial thrombosis, renal artery stenosis (Goldblatt kidney), or AVF  . Arteriography may   be required. Treatment, including medical management, excision of the ischaemic parenchymal segment,   vascular reconstruction, or nephrectomy, is indicated if hypertension persists [121].  Arteriovenous fistulae usually present with delayed onset of significant haematuria, most often after   penetrating trauma. Percutaneous embolisation is often effective for symptomatic AVF  , but larger fistulae may   require surgery [125]. The development of pseudo-aneurysm is a rare complication following blunt trauma.",
Recommendations   Strength rating,
Evaluation,
Assess haemodynamic stability upon admission.,Strong
"Record past renal surgery, and known pre-existing renal abnormalities (ureteropelvic   junction obstruction, solitary kidney, urolithiasis).",Strong
Test for haematuria in a patient with suspected renal injury.,Strong
"Perform a multiphase computed tomography (CT) scan in trauma patients with:  •   visible haematuria;  •   non-visible haematuria and one episode of hypotension;  •   a history of rapid deceleration injury and/or significant associated injuries;  •   penetrating trauma;  •   clinical signs suggesting renal trauma e.g. flank pain, abrasions, fractured ribs,   abdominal distension and/or a mass and tenderness.",Strong
Management,
Manage stable patients with blunt renal trauma non-operatively with close monitoring and   Strong  re-imaging as required.,
Manage isolated Grade 1-4 stab and low-velocity gunshot wounds in stable patients non-  Strong  operatively.,
