"5.3.2	  Enucleation of the prostate  5.3.2.1	  Open prostatectomy  Mechanism of action: Open prostatectomy is the oldest surgical treatment for moderate-to-severe LUTS   secondary to BPO. Obstructive adenomas are enucleated using the index finger, approaching from within   the bladder (Freyer procedure) or through the anterior prostatic capsule (Millin procedure). It is used for   substantially enlarged glands (> 80-100 mL).",
Summary of evidence,LE
"Open prostatectomy is an effective and durable procedure for the treatment of LUTS/BPO, but it is the   most invasive surgical method.",1b
Open prostatectomy shows similar short- and mid-term efficacy to B-TUEP and HoLEP for treating   moderate-to-severe LUTS secondary to BPO in patients with large prostates.,1a
Open prostatectomy has a less favourable peri-operative safety profile compared to B-TUEP and   HoLEP.,1a
The long-term functional results of OP are comparable to HoLEP.,1b
