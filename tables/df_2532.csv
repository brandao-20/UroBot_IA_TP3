7.4.4.1.2  Summary of evidence and recommendations for immunotherapy in cc-mRCC,
Summary of evidence   LE,
Treatment-naïve patients,
"Currently, PD-L1 expression is not used for patient selection.",2b
The combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab in treatment-naïve patients with cc-mRCC of IMDC   intermediate- and poor risk demonstrated OS and ORR benefits compared to sunitinib alone.,1b
"The combination of pembrolizumab plus axitinib, lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab and nivolumab plus   cabozantinib in treatment-naïve patients with cc-mRCC across all IMDC risk groups demonstrated   PFS, OS and ORR benefits compared to sunitinib.",1b
"Nivolumab plus ipilimumab, pembrolizumab plus axitinib, nivolumab plus cabozantinib and lenvatinib   plus pembrolizumab should be administered in centres with experience of immune combination   therapy and appropriate supportive care within the context of a multidisciplinary team.",4
The combination of nivolumab plus ipilimumab in the IMDC intermediate- and poor-risk population of   treatment-naïve patients with cc-mRCC leads to superior survival compared to sunitinib.,2b
Sequencing systemic therapy,
Nivolumab leads to superior OS compared to everolimus in disease progression after one or two lines   of VEGF-targeted therapy.,1b
"Axitinib, cabozantinib or lenvatinib can be continued if immune-related AEs result in cessation   of axitinib plus pembrolizumab, cabozantinib plus nivolumab or lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab.   Re-challenge with immunotherapy requires expert support.",4
"Patients who do not receive the full four doses of ipilimumab due to toxicity should continue on single-  agent nivolumab, where safe and feasible. Re-challenge with combination therapy requires expert   support.",4
Treatment past progression can be justified but requires close scrutiny and the support of an expert   multidisciplinary team.,1b
Nivolumab plus ipilimumab was associated with 46% grade 3–4 toxicity and 1.5% treatment-related   deaths. Tyrosine kinase inhibitor-based IO combination therapies were associated with grade 3–5   toxicity ranging between 61–72% and 1% of treatment-related deaths.,1b
Recommendations  Strength rating,
Treatment-naïve patients,
Offer treatment with PD1 combinations in centres with experience.,Weak
"Offer either nivolumab plus ipilimumab, pembrolizumab plus axitinib, or lenvatinib plus   pembrolizumab, or nivolumab plus cabozantinib to treatment-naive patients with IMDC   intermediate- or poor-risk disease.",Strong
"Offer either pembrolizumab plus axitinib, lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab or nivolumab plus   cabozantinib to treatment-naïve patients with IMDC favourable risk.",Weak
Offer sunitinib or pazopanib to treatment-naive patients with IMDC favourable risk.,Weak
Offer sunitinib or pazopanib to treatment-naive cc-mRCC patients with any IMDC risk who   cannot receive or tolerate immune checkpoint inhibition.,Strong
Offer cabozantinib to treatment-naive patients with IMDC intermediate- and poor-risk   cc-mRCC who cannot receive or tolerate immune checkpoint inhibition.,Stronga
"Patients who do not receive the full four doses of ipilimumab due to toxicity should continue   on single-agent nivolumab, where safe and feasible. Re-challenge with combination therapy   requires expert support.",Weak
Sequencing systemic therapy,
Sequence systemic therapy in treating mRCC.,Strong
Offer VEGF-tyrosine kinase inhibitors as second-line therapy to patients refractory to   nivolumab plus ipilimumab or axitinib plus pembrolizumab or cabozantinib plus nivolumab or   lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab.,Weak
Sequencing the agent not used as second-line therapy (nivolumab or cabozantinib) for third-  line therapy is recommended.,Weak
Offer nivolumab or cabozantinib to those patients who received first-line VEGF targeted   therapy alone.,Strong
Treatment past progression can be justified but requires close scrutiny and the support of an   expert multi disciplinary team.,Weak
Do not re-challenge patients who stopped immune checkpoint inhibitors because of toxicity   without expert guidance and support from a multidisciplinary team.,Strong
