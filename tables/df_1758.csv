"3.20.2	  Paediatric ureteral trauma  Injuries to the ureter are rare. The ureter is well protected; the upper part is protected by its close   approximation to the vertebral column and paraspinal muscles and the lower part by its route through the   bony pelvis. In addition, the ureter is a small target, and both flexible and mobile. This also means that ureteral   injuries are caused more often by penetrating trauma than blunt trauma [1458]. Since the ureter is the sole   conduit for urinary transport between the kidney and the bladder, any ureteral injury can threaten the function   of the ipsilateral kidney.",
