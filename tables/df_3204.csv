"10.2.1.4.8	 Phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors  Low doses of PDE5Is have a paradoxical effect in alleviating and preventing stuttering priapism; mainly in   patients with idiopathic and SCD-associated priapism [1573, 1607, 1668, 1694-1698] (LE: 3). It is important to   remember that therapy should be started when the penis is in its flaccid state and not during an acute episode.   There is a delay of one week before treatment is effective. There are no reported impairments in male sexual   function (LE: 3). Phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor treatment of stuttering priapism is possibly mediated by   an increase in the concentration of cGMP in the smooth muscle in an NO dysfunctional state. This can occur   in priapism and may result in a change in the NO pathway, with down-regulation of cavernosal PDE5 thereby   preventing the complete degradation of cGMP in the corpus cavernosum [1573, 1607, 1668, 1694].",
Recommendations,Strength rating
"Take a comprehensive history to establish the diagnosis, which can help to determine the   priapism subtype.",Strong
"Include a physical examination of the genitalia, perineum and abdomen in the diagnostic   evaluation.",Strong
Include a neurological examination if neurogenic non-ischaemic priapism is suspected.,Strong
"For laboratory testing, include complete blood count, with white blood cell differential, and   coagulation profile.",Strong
Analyse the blood gas parameters from blood aspirated from the penis to differentiate   between ischaemic and non-ischaemic priapism.,Strong
