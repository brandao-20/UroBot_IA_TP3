Summary of evidence,LE,,,,,,,
ReDo VUA has patency rates of 60-91% in non-irradiated patients and 67% in irradiated patients with   obliterative VUAS or VUAS refractory to endoluminal treatment.,3,,,,,,,
Urinary incontinence is inevitable after transperineal ReDo VUA. Artificial urinary sphincter placement   can be offered after three to six months if patency of ReDo VUA is ensured.,3,,,,,,,
De novo incontinence with retropubic ReDo VUA is 0-58%.,3,,,,,,,
Recommendations,Strength rating,,,,,,,
Perform ReDo vesico-urethral anastomosis (VUA) in non-irradiated patients and irradiated   patients with adequate bladder function with obliterative vesico-urethral anastomosis   stricture or vesico-urethral anastomosis stricture refractory to endoluminal treatment.,Weak,,,,,,,
"Warn patient that urinary incontinence (UI) is inevitable after transperineal ReDo VUA and   that subsequent anti-UI surgery might be needed in a next stage, after at least three to six   months.",Strong,,,,,,,
Offer ReDo VUA by retropubic approach if the patient is pre-operatively continent.,Weak,,,,,,,
Summary of evidence,LE,,,,,,,
Bladder neck reconstruction with Y-V or T-plasty for treatment refractory BNS has patency rates of   83-100%.,3,,,,,,,
Incontinence occurs in up to 14% with bladder neck reconstruction and up to 25% after   reconstruction of BMS after previous surgery for BPO.,3,,,,,,,
