Recommendations,Strength rating,,,,,
Offer panurethral urethroplasties in specialised centres because different techniques and   materials might be needed.,Weak,,,,,
Combine techniques to treat panurethral strictures if one technique is not able to treat the   whole extent of the stricture.,Weak,,,,,
