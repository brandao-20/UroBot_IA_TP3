Grade III,"Mild or moderate dilatation of the ureter, with or without kinking; moderate dilatation of the   collecting system; normal or minimally deformed fornices"
Grade IV,"Moderate dilatation of the ureter with or without kinking; moderate dilatation of the collecting   system; blunt fornices, but impressions of the papillae still visible"
