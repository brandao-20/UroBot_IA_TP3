Recommendations,Strength rating,
Do not delay diagnosis and treatment of any neonate presenting with ambiguous genitalia   since salt-loss in a 46XX CAH girl can be fatal.,Strong,
"Refer children to experienced centres where neonatology, endocrinology, (paediatric)   urology, psychology and transition to adult care are guaranteed.",Strong,
Utilise a multi-disciplinary approach and a shared decision model in patients with DSD   conditions including:  a. Gender assigment  b. Genital surgery (in accordance with national regulations)  c. Gonadectomy,Strong,
"Do not underestimate the significant effects on psychological and psychiatric health, quality   of life, personal relationships, and sexual function in individuals with DSD.",Strong,
Ensure full disclosure to patients and caregivers that the presence of a Y-chromosome in   dysgenetic gonads results in a higher malignancy risk,Strong,
