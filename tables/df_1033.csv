"3.6.2	  Diagnostic accuracy  Clinical diagnosis and cystometric findings sometimes do not correlate [66, 67] and asymptomatic women   may have abnormalities on urodynamic testing. The diagnostic accuracy of urethral pressure profilometry [68]   and urethral retro-resistance pressure measurement in SUI is poor [29]. Valsalva leak point pressure did not   reliably assess UI severity in a cohort of women selected for surgical treatment of SUI [69]. Urethral pressure   reflectometry may have greater diagnostic accuracy but its clinical role remains unclear [70]. Ambulatory   urodynamics may detect unexpected physiological variance from normal more often than conventional   cystometry does, but the clinical relevance of this is also uncertain [71, 72].",
Recommendations,Strength rating
Measure post-void residual (PVR) volume in patients with LUTS during initial assessment.,Strong
Use ultrasound to measure PVR volume.,Strong
Monitor PVR volume in patients receiving treatments that may cause or worsen voiding   dysfunction.,Strong
Provide bladder voiding efficiency as an additional parameter when measuring PVR volume. Weak,
