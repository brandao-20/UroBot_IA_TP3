Summary of evidence,LE,,,,,
Testosterone therapy is contraindicated in men with secondary hypogonadism who desire fertility.,1a,,,,,
"Testosterone therapy is contraindicated in men with active prostate cancer or breast cancer, as these   patients are usually excluded from RCTs.",1a,,,,,
"Testosterone therapy does not increase the risk of prostate cancer, but long-term prospective follow-  up data are required to validate this statement.",1a,,,,,
"The effect of testosterone therapy in men with severe lower-urinary tract symptoms is limited, as these   patients are usually excluded from RCTs.",1a,,,,,
"There is no substantive evidence that testosterone therapy, when replaced to normal levels, results in   the development of major adverse cardiovascular events.",1a,,,,,
"There is no evidence of a relationship between testosterone therapy and mild, moderate or CPAP-  treated severe sleep apnoea.",1b,,,,,
Recommendations,Strength rating,,,,,
"Fully counsel symptomatic hypogonadal men who have been surgically treated for localised   prostate cancer (PCa) and who are currently without evidence of active disease considering   testosterone therapy, emphasising the benefits and lack of sufficient safety data on long-  term follow-up.",Weak,,,,,
"Restrict treatment to patients with a low risk for recurrent PCa (i.e., pre-operative PSA    < 10 ng/mL; Gleason score < 7 [International Society for Urological Pathology grade 1];    cT1-2a)* and treatment should start after at least one year follow-up with PSA level    < 0.01 ng/mL.",Weak,,,,,
Advise patients that safety data on the use of testosterone therapy in men treated for breast   cancer are unknown.,Strong,,,,,
Assess cardiovascular risk factors before commencing testosterone therapy.,Strong,,,,,
Assess men with known cardiovascular disease (CVD) for cardiovascular symptoms before   testosterone therapy and with close clinical assessment and evaluation during treatment.,Strong,,,,,
"Treat men with hypogonadism and pre-existing CVD, venous-thromboembolism or chronic   cardiac failure, who require testosterone therapy with caution, by careful clinical monitoring   and regular measurement of haematocrit (not exceeding 54%) and testosterone levels.",Weak,,,,,
Exclude a family history of venous-thromboembolism before starting testosterone therapy.,Strong,,,,,
"Monitor testosterone, haematocrit at three, six and twelve months after testosterone therapy   initiation, and thereafter annually. A haematocrit > 54% should require testosterone therapy   withdrawal and phlebotomy. Re-introduce testosterone therapy at a lower dose once the   haematocrit has normalised and consider switching to topical testosterone preparations.",Strong,,,,,
"Evaluate patients with polycythaemia vera and those with a higher risk of developing   elevated haematocrit every three months during the first year of testosterone therapy, and at   least every six months thereafter.",Strong,,,,,
"Evaluate total PSA in PCa survivors at three, six and twelve months during the first year of   testosterone therapy, and annually thereafter.",Strong,,,,,
