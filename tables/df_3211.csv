11.4.1.3	  Summary of evidence recommendations for cryptorchidism,
Recommendations,Strength rating
"Advise men with testicular microcalcification (TM) to perform self-examination even without   additional risk factors, as this may result in early detection of testicular germ cell tumour   (TGCT).",Weak
"Do not perform testicular biopsy, follow-up scrotal ultrasound (US), measure biochemical   tumour markers, or abdominal or pelvic computed tomography, in men with isolated   TM without associated risk factors (e.g., infertility, cryptorchidism, testicular cancer, and   atrophic testis).",Strong
"Testicular biopsy may be offered to infertile men with TM, who belong to one of the   following higher risk groups: spermatogenic failure (infertility), bilateral TM, atrophic testes   (< 12 mL), history of undescended testes and TGCT.",Weak
"Perform inguinal surgical exploration with testicular biopsy or offer orchidectomy after multi-  disciplinary meeting and discussion with the patient, if there are suspicious findings on   physical examination or US in patients with TM with associated lesions",Strong
"Manage men treated for TGCT in a multi-disciplinary team setting with a dedicated   late-effects clinic since they are at increased risk of developing hypogonadism, sexual   dysfunction and cardiovascular risk.",Weak
"Perform sperm cryopreservation prior to planned orchidectomy or before additional   neoadjuvant or adjuvant oncological therapies, since men with testis cancer may have   significant semen abnormalities (including azoospermia).",Weak
Offer onco-testicular sperm extraction (onco-TESE) at the time of radical orchidectomy   to men with testicular cancer and azoospermia or severe abnormalities in their semen   parameters.,Weak
