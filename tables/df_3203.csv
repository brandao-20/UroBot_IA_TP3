"10.2.1.4.8	 Phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors  Low doses of PDE5Is have a paradoxical effect in alleviating and preventing stuttering priapism; mainly in   patients with idiopathic and SCD-associated priapism [1573, 1607, 1668, 1694-1698] (LE: 3). It is important to   remember that therapy should be started when the penis is in its flaccid state and not during an acute episode.   There is a delay of one week before treatment is effective. There are no reported impairments in male sexual   function (LE: 3). Phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor treatment of stuttering priapism is possibly mediated by   an increase in the concentration of cGMP in the smooth muscle in an NO dysfunctional state. This can occur   in priapism and may result in a change in the NO pathway, with down-regulation of cavernosal PDE5 thereby   preventing the complete degradation of cGMP in the corpus cavernosum [1573, 1607, 1668, 1694].",
Recommendations,Strength rating
Manage each acute episode similar to that for ischaemic priapism.,Strong
Use hormonal therapies (mainly gonadotropin-receptor hormone agonists or antagonists)   and/or anti-androgens for the prevention of future episodes in patients with frequent   relapses. Do not use them before sexual maturation is reached.,Weak
Initiate treatment with phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors only when the penis is in its   flaccid state.,Weak
"Use digoxin, Î±-adrenergic agonists, baclofen, gabapentin or terbutaline only in patients with   frequent and uncontrolled relapses.",Weak
Use intracavernous self-injections of sympathomimetic drugs at home for treatment of   acute episodes on an interim basis until ischaemic priapism has been alleviated.,Weak
