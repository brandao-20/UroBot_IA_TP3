Summary of evidence,LE,,,,
Retrograde urethrography and urethrocystoscopy are able to identify anatomical success after a   urethroplasty.,2a,,,,
A significant gap was demonstrated between objective and subjective outcomes after urethroplasties.   PROM questionnaires are specific tools to assess subjective outcomes and patient satisfaction after   urethroplasty surgeries.,2a,,,,
Validated questionnaires proved useful to assess the consequences of urethral surgery on sexual function.,2a,,,,
Recommendations,Strength rating,,,,
Use cystoscopy or retrograde urethrography to assess anatomic success after urethroplasty   surgery.,Weak,,,,
Use PROM questionnaires to assess subjective outcomes and patient satisfaction.,Strong,,,,
Use validated questionnaires to evaluate sexual function after urethral stricture surgeries.,Strong,,,,
