"4.4.3	  Specific treatment  General preventive measures are recommended for fluid intake and diet. Hyperoxaluric stone formers should   consume foods with low oxalate content, whereas hyperuricosuric stone formers benefit from daily dietary   reduction of purine. Figure 4.3 summarises the pharmacological treatment of calcium oxalate stones [597, 604,   627-630, 633, 634, 636, 640, 643-645, 649-656, 664, 666-669]. There is only low-level evidence for the efficacy   of preventing stone recurrence based on pre-treatment stone composition examination and biochemistry   measures, or on-treatment biochemistry measures [597].",
