Table 3.3: High-risk stone formers [20-36]
General factors
Early onset of urolithiasis (especially children and teenagers)
Familial stone formation
Recurrent stone formers
Short time since last stone episode
Brushite-containing stones (CaHPO4.2H2O)
Uric acid and urate-containing stones
Infection stones
"Solitary kidney (the kidney itself does not particularly increase the risk of stone formation, but prevention of   stone recurrence is of crucial importance to avoid acute renal failure)"
Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD)
Diseases associated with stone formation
Hyperparathyroidism
Metabolic syndrome
Mineral Bone Disorder (MBD)
Nephrocalcinosis
Polycystic kidney disease (PKD)
"Gastrointestinal diseases (i.e., jejuno-ileal bypass, intestinal resection, Crohnâ€™s disease, malabsorptive   conditions, enteric hyperoxaluria after urinary diversion, exocrine pancreatic insufficiency) and bariatric   surgery"
Increased levels of vitamin D
Sarcoidosis
"Spinal cord injury, neurogenic bladder"
Genetically determined stone formation
"Cystinuria (type A, B and AB)"
Primary hyperoxaluria (PH)
Renal tubular acidosis (RTA) type I
"2,8-Dihydroxyadeninuria"
Xanthinuria
Lesch-Nyhan syndrome
Cystic fibrosis
Drug-induced stone formation (see Table 4.11)
Anatomical abnormalities associated with stone formation
Medullary sponge kidney (tubular ectasia)
Ureteropelvic junction (UPJ) obstruction
"Calyceal diverticulum, calyceal cyst"
Ureteral stricture
