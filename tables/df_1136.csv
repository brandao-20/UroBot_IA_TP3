Parameter,Basis,Population,Values
Watt’s factor [469],"Hill equation of muscle   contraction in a spherical   organ, with fixed   constants obtained from   experimental and clinical   studies",Eight asymptomatic   female volunteers aged   28–45 years (median 34   years),"Ideal voiding (bell-shaped flow   curves): WFmax 11-24 W/m2  Non-ideal voiding: WFmax    5−10 W/m2  Normally WFmax > 7 W/m2   (expert opinion, unspecified   population) [474]"
"Projected isovolumetric   pressure (cm H2O) and   BCI, using PIP as an   index [470, 475]","Bladder output relation,   simplified to a straight line   with fixed slope of    5 cm H2O/mL/s (formula:   PdetQmax + 5xQmax)","Unspecified population,   mainly men with BPO",Classification based on expert   opinion:  > 150: strong contraction  100–150: normal contraction  50–100: weak contraction  < 50: very weak contraction
Projected isovolumetric   pressure 1 (cm H2O)   [471],Comparison of Qmax and   PdetQmax values with stop   test results  (Formula: pdetQmax + Qmax),100 women with UUI   aged 53–89 (mean 70)   years,5th-95th percentile: 29–78 cm   H2O  Mean: 49 cm H2O  Median: 48 cm H2O  Proposed typical values:   30-75 cm H2O
Continuous occlusion   test [472],Direct measurement of   isovolumetric voiding   contraction,70 women with UUI   aged 53–89 (mean: 70)   years,Mean ± SD: 48.7 ± 24.4 cm   H2O
