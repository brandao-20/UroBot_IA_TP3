"6.3.1.3	  Anastomotic urethroplasty in men with penile urethral strictures  Historically, the use of anastomotic urethroplasty in the management of urethral stricture disease has been   discouraged due to the risk of chordee post-operatively [263, 284]. Nevertheless, it has been performed in   selected patients with very short strictures (usually < 1 cm) with 80-93% patency rate, with satisfactory QoL   and sexual function and without any case of chordee [285] and with results comparable to augmentation   urethroplasty [286].",
