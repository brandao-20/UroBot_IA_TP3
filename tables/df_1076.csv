"4.2.4.3.4	 Surgery for stress urinary incontinence in special patient groups  4.2.4.3.4.1	Stress urinary incontinence surgery in obese women  There is no agreement about the outcome of incontinence surgery in obese women. Secondary analysis of an RCT   on retropubic and transobturator tapes for treatment of women with SUI suggests that obese women experience   inferior outcome compared to non-obese women. Stratification of patients according to BMI (< 30 and > 30) shows   a significant difference in objective dry rates (negative pad test) at one year (85.6% vs. 67.8%) and five years   (87.4% vs. 65.9%) and subjective cure (absence of SUI symptoms) at one year (85.8% vs. 70.7%) and five   years (76.7% vs. 53.6%). At one and five years, 6.7% and 16.3% of patients who were initially dry (negative   pad test) after surgery developed a positive pad test [426, 427].",
Summary of evidence,LE
Implantation of an artificial sphincter improves or cures incontinence in women with SUI caused by   sphincter insufficiency.,3
Implantation of the AUS device may improve complicated SUI.,3
Implantation of the ACT® device may improve complicated SUI.,3
"Complications, mechanical failure, and device explantation often occur with both the artificial   sphincter and ACT®.",3
Explantation of AUS is more frequent in older women and among those who have had previous Burch   colposuspension or pelvic radiotherapy.,3
