"5.6.5.2.3	 Autologous slings  The strategy of intra-operative placement of an autologous vas deferens sling below the vesico-urethral   anastomosis during robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) has been explored with the intention to   improve early return of continence. Two RCTs [653, 654] showed an advantage of sling vs. no sling at one-  month follow-up, and another study [655] showed an advantage of a 6-branch vs. a 2-branch sling at one   month follow-up. However, a larger RCT (n=195), showed that continence rate and near-continence rate were   similar between groups at six months with 66% vs. 65% and 86% vs. 88%, respectively [656].",
