"4.3.1	  Epidemiology, aetiology and pathophysiology  The prevalence rates of MUI vary widely in the literature. Most epidemiological studies have either not   considered subtypes of UI, or only reported on SUI, UUI and MUI. The current literature is unclear regarding   the population prevalence and risks for the different UI subtypes [435]. There are many urinary symptom   questionnaires used in epidemiological research, with varying evidence of validity. Caution is needed when   comparing epidemiological studies that do or do not report a separate MUI subgroup, and when generalising   from population level data to clinical practice. The problems arise from significant heterogeneity in terms of   types of questionnaires/surveys used, population parameters, variable response rates, varying definitions of   MUI, and outcome measures.",
Summary of evidence,LE
"Incontinence surgery may be safely performed in obese women; however, outcomes may be inferior.",1
"The risk of failure from surgical repair of SUI, and the risk of adverse events, appears to increase with   age.",2b
There is no evidence that any surgical procedure has greater efficacy or safety in older women than   another procedure.,4
