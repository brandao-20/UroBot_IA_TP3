Summary of evidence,LE
"Individual histologic lesions like glomerulosclerosis, arterial luminal narrowing or tubulointerstitial injury   observed in donor kidney biopsies have limited prognostic value for long-term allograft survival.",3
"Composite histological scoring systems provide a more comprehensive measure of overall organ   damage. However, published scoring systems still lack independent validation and robust thresholds.",3
"Size of the biopsy is of critical importance for its diagnostic value. An adequate biopsy reaches   beyond the immediate subcapsular area (> 5 mm) and contains > 25 glomeruli and > one artery.   Needle biopsies, wedge biopsies or specimens obtained with a skin punch biopsy device will result in   equally adequate biopsies if sampling is properly performed. Obtaining adequate biopsies with 18 G   needles is difficult and requires multiple cores.",3
