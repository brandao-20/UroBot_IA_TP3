Summary of evidence and guidelines for systemic and palliative therapies for advanced penile,
Summary of evidence,LE
Low-level data support the use of platinum-based chemotherapy as first-line systemic therapy in   advanced disease.,3
Effective second-line palliative chemotherapy regimens are lacking. Second-line chemotherapy in   multiple studies was associated with median OS of six months or less.,3
"Initial phase II or basket studies assessed anti-EGFR therapy or checkpoint inhibition, as monotherapy   or combination therapy, in advanced disease. Early evidence of promising clinical activity has been   reported in patients with penile cancer.",2b

"Offer patients with distant metastatic disease, platinum-based chemotherapy as the   preferred approach to first-line palliative systemic therapy.",Weak
Do not offer bleomycin because of the pulmonary toxicity risk.,Strong
"Offer patients with progressive disease under platinum chemotherapy the opportunity to   enroll in clinical trials, including experimental therapies within phase I or basket trials.",Strong
