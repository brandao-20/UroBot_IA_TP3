"3.1.7.4	  Venous thrombosis  Transplant renal vein thrombosis is an early complication (prevalence 0.5-4%) and one of the most important   causes of graft loss during the first post-operative month [182]. The aetiology includes technical errors and/or   difficulties during surgery [177] and the hypercoagulative state of the recipient [183, 184]. Colour-Doppler-flow-  ultrasonography shows absence of venous flow with an abnormal arterial signal (usually a plateau-like reversed   diastolic flow). Furthermore, it is common to see an enlargement of the graft due to venous congestion [185].   Surgical exploration is usually recommended despite the fact that the majority of the cases will result in graft   loss. In those cases where the venous thrombosis has not resulted in kidney loss at surgical exploration,   a venotomy with surgical thrombectomy after clamping the iliac vein can be performed. Alternatively, an   explantation and subsequent re-implantation can be considered [177]. Thrombolytic agents can also be used;   however, their results have not been satisfactory [177, 186, 187].",

Perform ultrasound-colour-Doppler in case of suspected graft thrombosis.,Strong
Perform surgical exploration in case of ultrasound finding of poor graft perfusion.,Weak
"If venous thrombosis is confirmed intra-operatively, perform a surgical thrombectomy in   case of a salvageable graft or an allograft nephrectomy in case of a non-viable graft.",Weak
Do not routinely use pharmacologic prophylaxis to prevent transplant renal vein thrombosis.,Strong
