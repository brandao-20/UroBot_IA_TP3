9.2.1.5	  Counselling and outcomes assessment - Validated questionnaires  The Augmentation Phalloplasty Patient Selection and Satisfaction Inventory (APPSSI) questionnaire is a 5-item   questionnaire proposed for the assessment and counselling about penile augmentation surgical treatment   [1465]. The Beliefs about Penis Size (BAPS) is a 10-item questionnaire created for audit and outcome research   to assess menâ€™s beliefs about penile size [1464]. Both questionnaires have failed to correlate with penile size   and lack of objective validation has restricted their use.,
Summary of evidence,LE
Medical/sexual history taking and physical examination are essential parts of the evaluation of men   with a short penis complaint.,4
Among stretched penile measurements STT may underestimate erect penile length.,2b
"Among stretched penile measurements BTT has a better correlation with erect penile length,   especially in overweight and obese men.",2b
Flaccid and erect state measurements to assess penile length may add useful information on penile   size.,4
Penile girth assessment may add useful information on penile size and shape.,4
"The Body Dysmorphic Disorder Questionnaire, The Cosmetic Procedure Screening Scale for Penile   Dysmorphic Disorder, The Male Genital Self-Image Scale and the Index of Male Genital Image are self-  reported tools useful to screen patients at risk for psychopathology.",2b
"Mental health counselling is helpful in detecting men requesting penile augmentation procedures   present with strong psychological vulnerability, including BDD/PDD.",2b
"Validated questionnaire (e.g., APPSSI, BAPS, IIEF-15, MSHQ, EDITS) are helpful in assessing baseline   sexual function and beliefs about penile size.",4
