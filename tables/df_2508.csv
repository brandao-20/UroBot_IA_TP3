"7.4.3	  Immunotherapy  7.4.3.1	  Immune checkpoint inhibitors  7.4.3.1.1	 Immuno-oncology monotherapy  Immune checkpoint inhibitor with monoclonal antibodies targets and blocks the inhibitory T-cell receptor PD-1   or cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4)-signalling to restore tumour-specific T-cell immunity   [512]. Immune checkpoint inhibitor monotherapy has been investigated as second- and third-line therapy. A   phase III trial of nivolumab vs. everolimus after one or two lines of VEGF-targeted therapy for mRCC with a   clear cell component (CheckMate 025, NCT01668784) reported a longer OS, better QoL and fewer grade 3 or   4 AEs with nivolumab than with everolimus [513]. Nivolumab has superior OS to everolimus (HR: 0.73, 95%   CI: 0.57–0.93, p < 0.002) in VEGF-refractory RCC with a median OS of 25 months for nivolumab and 19.6   months for everolimus with a 5-year OS probability of 26% vs. 18% [514] (LE: 1b). Patients who had failed   multiple lines of VEGF-targeted therapy were included in this trial making the results broadly applicable. The   trial included 15% MSKCC poor-risk patients. There was no PFS advantage with nivolumab despite the OS   advantage. Progression-free survival does not appear to be a reliable surrogate of outcome for PD-1 therapy in   RCC. Currently PD-L1 biomarkers are not used to select patients for this therapy.",
Recommendations  Strength rating,
Treatment-naïve patients,
Offer treatment with PD1 combinations in centres with experience.,Weak
"Offer either nivolumab plus ipilimumab, pembrolizumab plus axitinib, or lenvatinib plus   pembrolizumab, or nivolumab plus cabozantinib to treatment-naive patients with IMDC   intermediate- or poor-risk disease.",Strong
"Offer either pembrolizumab plus axitinib, lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab or nivolumab plus   cabozantinib to treatment-naïve patients with IMDC favourable risk.",Weak
Offer sunitinib or pazopanib to treatment-naive patients with IMDC favourable risk.,Weak
Offer sunitinib or pazopanib to treatment-naive cc-mRCC patients with any IMDC risk who   cannot receive or tolerate immune checkpoint inhibition.,Strong
Offer cabozantinib to treatment-naive patients with IMDC intermediate- and poor-risk   cc-mRCC who cannot receive or tolerate immune checkpoint inhibition.,Stronga
"Patients who do not receive the full four doses of ipilimumab due to toxicity should continue   on single-agent nivolumab, where safe and feasible. Re-challenge with combination therapy   requires expert support.",Weak
Sequencing systemic therapy,
Sequence systemic therapy in treating mRCC.,Strong
Offer VEGF-tyrosine kinase inhibitors as second-line therapy to patients refractory to   nivolumab plus ipilimumab or axitinib plus pembrolizumab or cabozantinib plus nivolumab or   lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab.,Weak
Sequencing the agent not used as second-line therapy (nivolumab or cabozantinib) for third-  line therapy is recommended.,Weak
Offer nivolumab or cabozantinib to those patients who received first-line VEGF targeted   therapy alone.,Strong
Treatment past progression can be justified but requires close scrutiny and the support of an   expert multi disciplinary team.,Weak
Do not re-challenge patients who stopped immune checkpoint inhibitors because of toxicity   without expert guidance and support from a multidisciplinary team.,Strong
