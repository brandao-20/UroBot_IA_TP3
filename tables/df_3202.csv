"10.2.1.4.8	 Phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors  Low doses of PDE5Is have a paradoxical effect in alleviating and preventing stuttering priapism; mainly in   patients with idiopathic and SCD-associated priapism [1573, 1607, 1668, 1694-1698] (LE: 3). It is important to   remember that therapy should be started when the penis is in its flaccid state and not during an acute episode.   There is a delay of one week before treatment is effective. There are no reported impairments in male sexual   function (LE: 3). Phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor treatment of stuttering priapism is possibly mediated by   an increase in the concentration of cGMP in the smooth muscle in an NO dysfunctional state. This can occur   in priapism and may result in a change in the NO pathway, with down-regulation of cavernosal PDE5 thereby   preventing the complete degradation of cGMP in the corpus cavernosum [1573, 1607, 1668, 1694].",

"The primary goal in the management of patients with stuttering priapism is prevention of future   episodes, which can generally be achieved pharmacologically.",2b
