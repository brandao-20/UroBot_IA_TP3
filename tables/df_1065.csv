"4.2.4.2.2	 Duloxetine  Duloxetine inhibits the presynaptic reuptake of neurotransmitters, serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT) and   noradrenaline (NE).   In the sacral spinal cord, an increased concentration of 5-HT and NE in the synaptic cleft increases   stimulation of 5-HT and NE receptors on the pudendal motor neurons, which in turn increases the resting tone   and contraction strength of the urethral striated sphincter.",
