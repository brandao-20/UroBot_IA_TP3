"3.1.2.3	  Methods of kidney preservation: static and dynamic preservation  Whichever method is used, cold storage is critical. The use of cold preservation as a therapeutic window   to deliver pharmacological or gene therapy treatments could, from an investigational point of view, improve   both short- and long-term graft outcomes [43]. Cooling reduces the metabolic rate of biological tissue   minimising continuous cellular processes that lead to depletion of ATP and accumulation of metabolic   products. Reperfusion with oxygenated blood invokes ischaemia-reperfusion injury. Hypothermic perfusion   does not enable normal cellular metabolic function or prevent depletion of energy stores [44]; however, it   prevents the deleterious effects of simple cooling, especially in the setting of prolonged warm-ischaemic time   in uncontrolled DCD donors. Two meta-analyses suggest that hypothermic machine perfusion (HMP) reduces   DGF compared with static cold storage [45, 46]. Outcomes for primary non-function (PNF) are less clear, but   one meta-analysis limited to high quality studies suggests a reduction in PNF rates with HMP [46]. A Cochrane   systematic review and meta-analysis showed that HMP reduced the risk of DGF when compared to static cold   storage (CS) for kidneys from both DCD and DBD donors [47].",
