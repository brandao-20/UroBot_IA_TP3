5.2.4.3	  Guidelines for MRI imaging in biopsy decision,
Summary of evidence,LE
"Literature review including multiple biopsy schemes suggests that a minimum 12-core scheme is   optimal in the majority of initial and repeat biopsy patients, dependent on prostate size. These biopsy   schemes should be heavily weighted towards the lateral aspect and the apex of the prostate to   maximize peripheral zone sampling [299].",3
"Systematic review and meta-analysis comparing MRI-targeted transrectal biopsy to MRI-targeted   transperineal biopsy, analysing 8 studies, showed a higher sensitivity for detection of csPCa when the   transperineal approach was used (86% vs. 73%).",2
"Current literature, including systematic reviews and meta-analyses, does not show a clear superiority   of one image-guided technique (cognitive guidance, US/MR fusion software or direct in-bore   guidance) over the other.",2
