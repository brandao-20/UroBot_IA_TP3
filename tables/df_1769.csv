Table 4: Recommendations for management in paediatric stones,,,
Stone size and   localisation*,Primary treatment   option,Alternative treatment   options,Comment
"Infant microlithiasis   (<3mm, any   location)",Observation,Intervention and/or   medical treatment,"Individualised decision according to size   progression, symptoms and metabolic   factors."
Staghorn stones,PCNL,Open/SWL,Multiple sessions and accesses with   PCNL may be needed. Combination    with SWL may be useful.
Pelvis < 10 mm,SWL,RIRS/PCNL,
Pelvis 10-20 mm,SWL/PCNL/RIRS,,Multiple sessions with SWL may be   needed. PCNL and RIRS have a similar   recommendation grade.
Pelvis > 20 mm,PCNL,SWL/RIRS,Multiple sessions with SWL may be   needed.
Lower pole calyx <   10mm,Observation or   SWL,PCNL/RIRS,Stone clearance after SWL is lower than   other locations.
Lower pole calyx >   10mm,PCNL,RIRS/SWL,Anatomical variations are important for   complete clearance after SWL.
Upper ureteric   stones,SWL,URS,Flexible scopes may be needed in case   of retropulsion.
Lower ureteric   stones,URS,SWL,
Bladder stones,Endoscopic   (transurethral or   percutaneous),SWL/Open,Open is easier and with less operative   time with large stones.
Summary of evidence,LE,,
The incidence of stone disease in children is increasing.,2,,
Contemporary surgical treatment is based on minimally invasive modalities. Open surgery is very   rarely indicated.,2a,,
The term ‘clinically insignificant residual fragments’ is not appropriate for children since most of them   become symptomatic and require intervention.,2b,,
Majority of the kidney stones < 3 mm in infants resolve spontaneously.,3,,
Recommendations,Strength rating,,
Use plain abdominal X-ray and ultrasound as the primary imaging techniques for the   diagnosis and follow-up of stones.,Strong,,
"Use low-dose non-contrast computed tomography in cases with a doubtful diagnosis,   especially of ureteral stones or complex cases requiring surgery.",Strong,,
"Perform a metabolic evaluation in any child with urinary stone disease. Any kind of   interventional treatment should be supported with medical treatment for the underlying   metabolic abnormality, if detected.",Strong,,
"Limit open surgery under circumstances in which the child is very young with large stones,   in association with congenital problems requiring surgical correction and/or with severe   orthopaedic deformities that limit positioning for endoscopic procedures.",Strong,,
"Observe infant microlithiasis, unless symptoms occur or size increases significantly.",Strong,,
