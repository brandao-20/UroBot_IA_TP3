Summary of evidence and guidelines for trimodality bladder-preserving treatment,
Recommendations,Strength rating
Offer surgical intervention or trimodality bladder-preserving treatments (TMT) to appropriate   candidates as primary curative therapeutic approaches since they are more effective than   radiotherapy alone.,Strong
"Offer TMT as an alternative to selected, well-informed and compliant patients, especially for   whom radical cystectomy is not an option or not acceptable.",Strong
Consensus statement,
"Candidates for curative treatment, such as cystectomy or bladder preservation, should be clinically assessed   by at least an oncologist, a urologist, a radiation oncologist (in case adjuvant radiotherapy or bladder   preservation is considered) and a neutral HCP such as a specialist nurse.",
An important determinant for patient eligibility in case of bladder-preserving treatment is absence of   carcinoma in situ.,
An important determinant for patient eligibility in case of bladder-preserving treatment is absence or presence   of hydronephrosis.,
"When assessing patient eligibility for bladder preservation, the likelihood of successful debulking surgery   should be taken into consideration (optimal debulking).",
"In case of bladder preservation with radiotherapy, combination with a radiosensitiser is always recommended   to improve clinical outcomes, such as cisplatin, 5-FU/MMC, carbogen/nicotinamide or gemcitabine.",
Radiotherapy for bladder preservation should be performed with IMRT and IGRT to reduce side effects.,
"Dose escalation above standard radical doses to the primary site in case of bladder preservation, either by   IMRT or by brachytherapy, is not recommended.",
