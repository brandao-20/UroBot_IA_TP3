3.16.5	  Summary of evidence and recommendations for the management of obstructive pathology of   renal duplication: ureterocele and ectopic ureter,
Summary of evidence,LE
"Ureterocele and ectopic ureter are associated with complete renal duplication, but they also occur in a   single system.",1
"In most cases, in young children (first years of life) diagnosis is done by US.",1
In older children clinical symptoms will prompt assessment.,1
"Management includes a conservative approach, endoscopic decompression, partial   nephroureterectomy, or complete primary reconstruction. Choice of treatment will depend on:  •   clinical status of the patient (e.g., urosepsis);  •   patient age;  •   function of the upper pole;  •   presence of reflux or obstruction of the ipsilateral or contralateral ureter;  •   presence of bladder neck obstruction caused by ureterocele;  •   intravesical or ectopic ureterocele.",3
