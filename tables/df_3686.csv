"6.2.2.2	  Effectiveness of dilatation compared with direct vision internal urethrotomy  A SR identified only one prospective RCT comparing dilatation with DVIU and failed to detect any differences   [196, 220]. In a small (n=56) retrospective cohort study, the three-year estimated stricture recurrence-free   survival was 35.5% and 28% for respectively balloon dilatation and DVIU (p=0.21) [221].",
Summary of evidence,LE
Visually controlled dilatation after endoscopic or fluoroscopic guidewire placement has a low   complication rate.,3
Repetitive dilatations/direct vision internal urethrotomy have no long-term freedom of recurrence and   increase stricture complexity.,1b
