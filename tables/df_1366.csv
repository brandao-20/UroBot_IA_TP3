"5.6.3.1.3	 Constipation  One RCT, with a majority female population, found that a multimodal intervention in elderly patients, involving   assisted toileting, fluid intake, etc., reduced the occurrence of UI and constipation, while behavioural therapy   appeared to improve both [573]. However, there is no evidence to show whether treating constipation improves   UI, although both constipation and UI appear to be improved by certain behavioural interventions.",
Summary of evidence,LE
"There is limited evidence that lifestyle interventions e.g., weight reduction, smoking cessation or diet   modification improves UI in males.",3
There is limited evidence that improving co-morbidities or changing drug regimens for underlying   disease improves UI in males.,3
Pads and/or penile sheaths are palliative options for management of UI.,1b
