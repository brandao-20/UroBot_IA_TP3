"3.5	  Acute scrotum  3.5.1	  Epidemiology, aetiology and pathophysiology  Acute scrotum is a paediatric urological emergency, most commonly caused by torsion of the testis or   appendix testis, or epididymitis/epididymo-orchitis [201-206]. Other causes of acute scrotal pain are idiopathic   scrotal oedema, mumps orchitis, varicocele, scrotal haematoma, incarcerated hernia, appendicitis or systemic   disease (e.g. Henoch-Sch√∂nlein purpura) [207-219]. Trauma can also be a cause of acute scrotum due to post-  traumatic haematomas, testicular contusion, rupture, dislocation or torsion [220-225]. Scrotal fat necrosis has   also been reported to be an uncommon cause of mild-to-moderate scrotal pain in pre-pubertal overweight   boys after exposure to cold [226].  In this chapter testicular torsion and epididymitis are discussed, while recurrent epididymitis is   discussed in the chapter dealing with infections. Torsion of the testis occurs most often in the neonatal period   and around puberty, whereas torsion of the appendix testis occurs over a wider age range [227]. Epididymitis   affects two age groups: less than one year and twelve to fifteen years [228, 229]. One study predicted the   annual incidence of epididymitis around 1.2 per 1,000 children [230].  Perinatal torsion of the testis most often occurs prenatally. Bilateral torsion comprises 11-21% of   all perinatal cases [231]. Most cases of perinatal torsion are extravaginal, in contrast to the usual intravaginal   torsion which occurs during puberty.",,
