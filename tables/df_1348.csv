"5.3.1.4	  Transurethral incision of the prostate  Mechanism of action: Transurethral incision of the prostate (TUIP) involves incising the bladder outlet without   relevant tissue removal. Transurethral incision of the prostate is conventionally performed with Collins knife   using electrocautery; however, alternative energy sources such as holmium laser may be used [350]. The   mainstay of this technique is in prostate sizes < 30 mL without a middle lobe.",
Summary of evidence,LE
"Laser vaporesection of the prostate using Tm:YAG laser (ThuVARP) has similar operation,   catheterisation and hospitalisation times compared to TURP. ThuVARP and TURP are equivalent in   terms of IPSS but not Qmax, with TURP deemed superior at twelve months follow-up. ThuVARP and   TURP show similar short-term safety. Mid- to long-term results on efficacy and safety compared to   TURP are very limited.",1b
