3.15.5	  Summary of evidence and recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of GUTB,
Summary of evidence,LE
The risk of reactivation of latent TB is estimated to be 15% in an individual’s lifetime.,2a
Smear microscopy for acid-fast bacilli has a low sensitivity in urine ranging from 0-25%.,2a
Studies have reported high specificities of 92–100% but low sensitivities of 23.3–30% for urine culture   in renal TB specimens.,2a
Xpert MTB/RIF pooled sensitivity and specificity were 84.7% (70.8 to 93.1) and 97.3% (91.0 to 99.2)   for the diagnosis of GUTB.,1b
Standard six month anti-tuberculous drug regimens are effective in all forms of TB (pulmonary and   extrapulmonary).,1a
There is limited evidence with regard to the optimum surgical approach and timing of surgery in GUTB   patients.,3
