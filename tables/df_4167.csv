"3.14.8	  Therapeutic vaccination  Three different vaccines against HPV have been licensed to date, but routine vaccination of males is currently   implemented in only a few countries including Australia, Canada, the USA and Austria16. The aim of male   vaccination is to reduce the rate of anal and penile cancers as well as head and neck cancers [415, 443].   A systematic review including a total of 5,294 patients reported vaccine efficacy against persisting   (at least six months) anogenital HPV16 infections of 46.9% (28.6-60.8%) and against persisting oral infections   of 88% (2–98%). A vaccine efficacy of 61.9% (21.4–82.8%) and 46.8% (20-77.9%) was observed against   anal intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 and 3 lesions, respectively [415]. The systematic review reported no   meaningful estimates on vaccine efficacy against penile intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or 3, and no data were   identified for anal, penile or head and neck squamous cell cancers [415].   A phase III clinical trial including 180 male patients evaluated the potential of MVA E2 recombinant   vaccinia virus to treat intraepithelial lesions associated with papillomavirus infection [444]. the study showed   promising results in terms of immune system stimulation against HPV lesions as well as regression in   intraepithelial lesions.",
Summary of evidence,LE
HPV vaccine is effective in the prevention of external genital lesions and genital warts in males.,1a
"HPV vaccination is moderately effective against genital HPV-related diseases irrespective of a   individuals HPV status; however, higher vaccine efficacy was observed in HPV-naïve males.",1a
"A systematic review of HPV vaccination barriers among adolescent and young adult males identified   a number of barriers to vaccine uptake including fear of side-effects, limited HPV awareness, financial   costs and changes in sexual activity.",1b
An intervention study to evaluate whether electronic messaging can increase HPV completion and   knowledge among college students concluded that intervention increased knowledge but not vaccine   completion.,2b
