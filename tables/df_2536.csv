Summary of evidence,LE,,,,,,,,
Functional follow-up after curative treatment for RCC is useful to prevent renal and cardiovascular   deterioration.,4,,,,,,,,
Oncological follow-up can detect local recurrence or metastatic disease while the patient may still be   surgically curable.,4,,,,,,,,
"After NSS, there is an increased risk of recurrence for larger (> 7 cm) tumours, or when there is a PSM.",3,,,,,,,,
Patients undergoing follow-up have a better OS than patients not undergoing follow-up.,3,,,,,,,,
Prognostic models provide stratification of RCC risk of recurrence based on TNM and histological   features.,3,,,,,,,,
"In competing-risk models, risk of non-RCC-related death exceeds that of RCC recurrence or related   death in low-risk patients.",3,,,,,,,,
Life expectancy estimation is feasible and may support counselling of patients on duration of follow-up.,4,,,,,,,,
Recommendations,Strength rating,,,,,,,,
Base follow-up after treatment of localised RCC on the risk of recurrence.,Strong,,,,,,,,
"Base risk of recurrence stratification on validated subtype-specific models such as the   Leibovich Score for ccRCC, or the University of California Los Angeles integrated staging   system for non-ccRCC.",Weak,,,,,,,,
Intensify follow-up in patients after NSS for tumours > 7 cm or in patients with a positive   surgical margin.,Weak,,,,,,,,
Consider curtailing follow-up when the risk of dying from other causes is double that of the   RCC recurrence risk.,Weak,,,,,,,,
