"11.4.2	  Germ cell malignancy and male infertility  Testicular germ cell tumour (TGCT) is the most common malignancy in Caucasian men aged 15-40 years, and   affects approximately 1% of sub-fertile men [1969]. The lifetime risk of TGCT varies among ethnic groups and   countries. The highest annual incidence of TGCT occurs in Caucasians, and varies from 10/100,000 (e.g., in   Denmark and Norway) to 2/100,000 (e.g., in Finland and the Baltic countries). Generally, seminomas and non-  seminomas are preceded by GCNIS, and untreated GCNIS eventually progresses to invasive cancer [1970-  1972]. There has been a general decline in male reproductive health and an increase in testicular cancer in   western countries [1973, 1974]. In almost all countries with reliable cancer registries, the incidence of testicular   cancer has increased [1860, 1975]. This has been postulated to be related to TDS, which is a developmental   disorder of the testes caused by environmental and/or genetic influences in pregnancy. As detailed above,   the adverse sequelae of TDS include cryptorchidism hypospadias, infertility and an increased risk of testicular   cancer [1944]. Endocrine disrupting chemicals have also been associated with sexual dysfunction [1976] and   abnormal semen parameters [1977]. These cancers arise from premalignant gonocytes or GCNIS [1978]. Testicular   microcalcification, seen on US, can be associated with TGCT and GCNIS of the testes [1927, 1979, 1980].",
Summary of evidence,LE
Cryptorchidism is multifactorial in origin and can be caused by genetic factors and endocrine   disruption early in pregnancy.,2a
Cryptorchidism is often associated with testicular dysgenesis and is a risk factor for infertility and   GCTs and patients should be counselled appropriately.,2b
Paternity in men with unilateral cryptorchidism is almost equal to men without cryptorchidism.,1b
Bilateral cryptorchidism significantly reduces the likelihood of paternity and patients should be   counselled appropriately.,1b
