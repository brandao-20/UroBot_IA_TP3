4.5.7.10	  Summary of evidence and recommendations for surgical management of bladder outlet obstruction,
Summary of evidence,LE
Intrasphincteric injection of botulinum toxin results in the improvement of symptoms and urodynamic   parameters.,2
Sacral nerve stimulation results in spontaneous voiding and a reduction in CISC rate in the majority of   female BOO patients in idiopathic urinary retention.,3
More serious adverse events and surgical revisions were associated with the one-stage neuromodulator   implantation procedure.,3
Repair of POP improved PVR and voiding symptoms.,3
"Urethral dilatation in women with BOO results in significant improvement in OAB symptoms, but   improvements in urodynamic parameters of voiding are inconsistent.",1b
Programmed intermittent urethral dilatation results in better outcomes compared with on-demand   dilatation.,3
"Effects of urethral dilation are poorly sustained, requiring repeat intervention in the long term.",3
Internal urethrotomy followed by regular dilatations resulted in significant improvement in symptoms   and urodynamic parameters in women with BOO.,3
Bladder neck incision in females with BOO results in improvements in symptoms and urodynamic   parameters.,3
"Complications of bladder neck incision are not common, but include VVF, SUI, and urethral stricture.",3
"Urethroplasty using grafts or flaps in women with BOO due to urethral stricture have good success   rates with significant improvements of symptoms, QoL scores and urodynamic parameters compared   to baseline.",3
Urethroplasty results in better QoL and Qmax compared to urethral dilatation.,2
Long-term results showed significant stricture recurrence rate after urethroplasty.,3
"Urethrolysis performed on women with voiding problems after anti-UI surgery resulted in   improvements in symptoms, QoL and urodynamic parameters post-operatively.",3
Delayed urethrolysis was associated with persistent post-operative bladder symptoms.,3
"Sling revision in women who presented with urinary retention or voiding problems and significant   PVRs after sling surgery for UI resulted in improvements in symptoms and urodynamic parameters,   resumption of voiding and reductions in PVRs.",3
Sling revision is associated with the risk of recurrent SUI.,3
