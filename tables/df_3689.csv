"6.3.1.3	  Anastomotic urethroplasty in men with penile urethral strictures  Historically, the use of anastomotic urethroplasty in the management of urethral stricture disease has been   discouraged due to the risk of chordee post-operatively [263, 284]. Nevertheless, it has been performed in   selected patients with very short strictures (usually < 1 cm) with 80-93% patency rate, with satisfactory QoL   and sexual function and without any case of chordee [285] and with results comparable to augmentation   urethroplasty [286].",
Summary of evidence,LE
"Stricture-free rates for single-stage penile augmentation urethroplasties range from 70%-100% for   dorsal OMG augmentation, 67-100% for penile skin flap (PSF) augmentation, 55-92.6% for ventral   OMG augmentation and 62-78% for dorsal SG augmentation. Overall stricture-free rates for staged   OMG penile augmentation urethroplasties range from 70-100%.",2b
"In staged urethroplasties, an interval of at least four to six months has been proposed before   proceeding to the tubularisation of the urethra, provided that the graft has healed uneventfully.",4
"The use of anastomotic urethroplasty in the management of urethral stricture disease has been   discouraged due to the risk of chordee post-operatively. Anastomotic urethroplasty can be offered in   selected cases of very short (< 1 cm), injury-associated penile strictures.",3
"In case of adverse intra-operative findings, a single-stage approach might not be feasible and must be   converted into a staged approach.",3
