"Patients with high-risk and those with very high-risk tumours treated conservatively should   undergo cystoscopy and urinary cytology at 3 months. If negative, subsequent cystoscopy   and cytology should be repeated every 3 months for a period of 2 years, and every 6   months thereafter until 5 years, and then yearly.",Weak,,,,,,,,
Patients with intermediate-risk Ta tumours should have an in-between (individualised)   follow-up scheme using cystoscopy.,Weak,,,,,,,,
Regular (yearly) upper tract imaging (computed tomography-intravenous urography [CT-IVU]   or IVU) is recommended for high-risk and very high-risk tumours.,Weak,,,,,,,,
Perform endoscopy under anaesthesia and bladder biopsies when office cystoscopy shows   suspicious findings or if urinary cytology is positive.,Strong,,,,,,,,
"During follow-up in patients with positive cytology and no visible tumour in the bladder,   mapping biopsies or PDD-guided biopsies (if equipment is available) and investigation of   extravesical locations (CT urography, prostatic urethra biopsy) are recommended.",Strong,,,,,,,,
