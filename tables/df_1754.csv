"3.19.2.4	  Presentation   The most common symptom at presentation is haematuria; other less common symptoms include abdominal   pain, storage LUTS including frequency, dysuria and at times obstructive symptoms [1406].",
Summary of evidence,LE
Majority of paediatric patients have no identifiable risk factors for bladder tumours.,3
There is no evidence on intravesical therapy for bladder tumours in children and adolescents.,4
Prognosis of papillary tumours of the bladder in children is good overall.,3
Inflammatory myofibroblastic bladder tumours are usually benign.,3
Paediatric EC cases are in a third of cases associated with a history of allergic conditions and in 50%   with significant eosinophilia or eosinophiluria.,4
Paediatric EC patients usually present with irritative and or obstructive urinary symptoms which can   mimic UTI or LUTS thereby leading to delayed diagnosis.,4
In paediatric EC definitive diagnosis can only be attained on tissue biopsy obtained by cystoscopy.,4
"In EC treatment with corticosteroids, antibiotics, anticholinergics, and antihistamines, in addition to   cyclosporine A have been utilised and lead to resolution of symptoms in most cases.",4
No standard follow-up recommendations exist however surveillance is justified as recurrence has   been reported in about a third of patients.,4
NA in children are rare benign lesions that usually occur in the setting of previous surgery or chronic   irritation of urinary tract and mainly occurring in the bladder.,4
NA usually presents with haematuria and or storage LUTS and with a papillary/polypoid mass on seen   on cystoscopy.,4
NA diagnosis is established by cystoscopy and histopathological review of biopsy specimen.,4
"NA treatment is excision either by transurethral resection which often requires reresections, partial   cystectomy or open excision.",4
NA recurrence rate is high thereby justifying regular follow-up.,4
