3.6  Summary of evidence and recommendations for the management of other renal tumours,
Summary of evidence,LE
"The most common renal tumours are three malignant types of RCC (clear cell, papillary and   chromophobe) and two benign renal tumours: oncocytoma and angiomyolipoma.",3
"A definitive histopathological diagnosis of oncocytoma cannot be made on a needle-core   biopsy, because chRCC can show intratumoural heterogeneity with areas very similar to   oncocytoma.",3
Recent histological work up and results of active surveillance of Bosniak III cysts shows low   risk of malignant potential/course.,2
