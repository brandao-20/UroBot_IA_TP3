"3.1.10.4	  Steroids  Steroids have a large number of side effects [242-244, 295], especially with long-term use. Most practitioners   still consider steroids (either prednisolone or methylprednisolone) to be a fundamental adjunct to primary   immunosuppression, even though successful steroid withdrawal has been achieved in the vast majority of   patients in many prospective, randomised trials [242, 244, 245, 295, 300, 301]. The risk of steroid withdrawal   depends on the use of concomitant immunosuppressive medication, immunological risk, ethnicity, and   time after transplantation. Although the risk of rejection diminishes over time, potential benefits may be less   prominent after a prolonged steroid treatment period [242-245, 295]. Recent studies suggest similar efficacy   but less diabetes after early steroid withdrawal or steroid minimisation in low-risk patients treated with   tacrolimus, MPA and induction (either basiliximab or ATG) [302, 303].",
Summary of evidence,LE
"Combination therapy with CNIs aggravates CNI-induced nephrotoxicity. Therefore, CNI dosage should   be substantially reduced in combination therapy with m-TOR inhibitors, which seems to have no   impact on efficacy, due to the highly synergistic potential of this combination therapy.",1
Take into consideration impaired wound healing and prophylactic surgical measures when m-TOR   inhibitors are used as part of the initial immunosuppressive regimen or when patients treated with   m-TOR inhibitors undergo major surgery.,1
"When combined with CNIs, antimicrobial prophylaxis for P. jirovecii pneumonia should be administered   for one year following transplantation.",1
"Conversion from CNIs is not advisable in patients with proteinuria > 800 mg/day, and a cautious and   individual approach should be followed in patients with GFR < 30 mL/min.",1
