3.4.5.1	  Summary of evidence and recommendations for SWL,
Recommendations,Strength rating
Use holmium:yttrium-aluminium-garnet (Ho:YAG) laser lithotripsy for (flexible) ureteroscopy   (URS).,Strong
Perform stone extraction only under direct endoscopic visualisation of the stone.,Strong
Do not insert a stent in uncomplicated cases.,Strong
Offer medical expulsive therapy for patients suffering from stent-related symptoms and after   Ho:YAG laser lithotripsy to facilitate the passage of fragments.,Strong
"Use percutaneous antegrade removal of ureteral stones as an alternative when shock   wave lithotripsy (SWL) is not indicated or has failed, and when the upper urinary tract is not   amenable to retrograde URS.",Strong
"Use flexible URS in cases where percutaneous nephrolithotomy or SWL are not an option   (even for stones > 2 cm). However, in this case there is a higher risk that a follow-up   procedure and placement of a ureteral stent may be needed.",Strong
