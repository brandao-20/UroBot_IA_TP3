"9.1	  Comparison of grafts with flaps  One small RCT (LS excluded) comparing OMG with PSF found no significant difference in urethral patency rate   [502]. Penile skin flaps had a higher urogenital morbidity (superficial penile skin necrosis, penile torsion, penile   hypoesthesia, and post-void dribbling) and longer operation time compared to OMG. Furthermore, patient   dissatisfaction was significantly higher with penile flaps [502]. Another small RCT (LS excluded) comparing   penile skin grafts with PSF confirmed these findings with longer operation time and more superficial penile skin   necrosis in the group of the flaps, whereas the urethral patency rate was similar between both groups [355].   Several retrospective series also found a comparable urethral patency rate between PSF and grafts [272, 274,   503, 504] (Table 9.1).",
Summary of evidence,LE
"After neophallic reconstruction, local tissues go through the different stages of wound healing and   stable wound healing is usually achieved after six months.",3
"After two attempts, endoscopic incision is no longer successful in trans men.",3
Two-stage urethroplasty for strictures at the neophallic urethra has a patency rate of 50-88% after   phalloplasty and up to 100% after metoidioplasty.,3
Y-V meatoplasty for short (< 1 cm) meatal stenosis in trans women has a stricture-free rate of 85%.,3
