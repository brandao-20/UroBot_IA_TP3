Table 3.1: Germline mutations in DNA repair genes associated with increased risk of prostate cancer,,,
Gene,Location,Prostate cancer risk,Findings
BRCA2,13q12.3,"- RR 2.5 to 4.6 [39, 40]  -  PCa at 55 years or   under: RR: 8–23    [39, 41]","•  up to 12 % of men with metastatic PCa harbour   germline mutations in 16 genes (including BRCA2   [5.3%]) [31]  •  2% of men with early-onset PCa harbour germline   mutations in the BRCA2 gene [39]  •  BRCA2 germline alteration is an independent predictor   of metastases and worse PCa-specific survival [35, 42]"
ATM,11q22.3,RR: 6.3 for metastatic  PCa [31],•  higher rates of lethal PCa among mutation carriers [37]  •  up to 12% of men with metastatic PCa harbour germline   mutations in 16 genes (including ATM [1.6%]) [31]
CHEK2,22q12.1,"OR 3.3 [43, 44]",•  up to 12% of men with metastatic PCa harbour germline   mutations in 16 genes (including CHEK2 [1.9%]) [31]
BRCA1,17q21,"RR: 1.8–3.8 at 65 years   or under [45, 46]",•  higher rates of lethal PCa among mutation carriers [37]  •  up to 12% of men with metastatic PCa harbour germline   mutations in 16 genes (including BRCA1 [0.9%]) [31]
HOXB13,17q21.2,"OR 3.4–7.9 [32, 47]","•  significantly higher PSA at diagnosis, higher Gleason   score and higher incidence of positive surgical margins   in the radical prostatectomy specimen than non-carriers   [48]"
MMR genes  MLH1  MSH2  MSH6  PMS2,3p21.3  2p21  2p16  7p22.2,RR: 3.7 [49],•  Mutations in MMR genes are responsible for Lynch   syndrome [50]  •  MSH2 mutation carriers are more likely to develop PCa   than other MMR gene mutation carriers [51]
