Summary of evidence,LE,,,,,
"Considering the wide spectrum and the complexity of surgical interventions aimed to address penile   shortness, this surgery should be reserved to high volume centres.",4,,,,,
"Suspensory ligament release, ventral phalloplasty and suprapubic lipoplasty/liposuction/lipectomy   provide an objective increase in penile length.",3,,,,,
"Suspensory ligament release, ventral phalloplasty and suprapubic lipoplasty/liposuction/lipectomy are   associated with a significant incidence of complications.",3,,,,,
Total phallic reconstruction provides satisfactory surgical and functional outcomes in men with   micropenis.,3,,,,,
Recommendations,Strength rating,,,,,
Perform penile reconstructive surgery for adult acquired buried penis in high volume   centres.,Strong,,,,,
"Use suspensory ligament release (SLR), ventral phalloplasty and suprapubic lipoplasty/  liposuction/lipectomy to address penile lengthening.",Weak,,,,,
"Extensively discuss possible complications related to SLR, ventral phalloplasty and   suprapubic lipoplasty/liposuction/lipectomy.",Strong,,,,,
Use total phallic reconstruction to restore genital anatomy in patients affected by congenital   micropenis.,Weak,,,,,
