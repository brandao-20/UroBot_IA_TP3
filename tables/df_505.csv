Summary of evidence,LE
"Adjuvant cisplatin-based chemotherapy for high-risk patients (pT3, 4 and/or or N+ M0) without   neoadjuvant treatment can be associated with improvement in DFS and OS but trials are   underpowered to adequately answer this question.",2a
"To date, studies of immune checkpoint inhibitors in the adjuvant setting in patients with high-risk    MIBC who have or have not received NAC have demonstrated conflicting results with the    CheckMate 274 study demonstrating an improvement in DFS with adjuvant nivolumab and the    IMvigor 010 study failing to show an improvement in DFS with adjuvant atezolizumab.",1b
Circulating tumour DNA holds promise as both a prognostic and predictive biomarker to guide the use   of adjuvant IO for UC in patients who are at a high risk of recurrence and positive for ctDNA treated   with adjuvant atezolizumab demonstrating improved outcomes compared with observation.,2b
