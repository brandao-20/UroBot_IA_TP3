"7.3.4.1	  Diagnostic value of lymphadenectomy   To understand the lymphatic spread in MIBC, two important autopsy studies have been performed. The first   study analysed 367 patients with a history of cystectomy or MIBC at the time of autopsy. In total, 215 patients   (59%) had node-positive disease [335]. In these patients 92% of the positive LNs were regional (perivesical or   pelvic), 72% retroperitoneal and 35% abdominal.   The second autopsy study focused on the nodal yield when super-extended pelvic LND was   performed. Substantial inter-individual differences were found with counts ranging from 10 to 53 nodes [336].   These findings demonstrate the limited utility of node count as a surrogate for extent of dissection, supporting   a template-based LND instead.",
Summary of evidence,LE
"Robot-assisted radical cystectomy has longer operative time (1–1.5 hours) and higher costs, but   shorter length of hospital stay (1–1.5 days) and less blood loss compared to ORC.",1
Robotic cystectomy and open cystectomy may result in similar rates of (major) complications.,2
"Most endpoints, if reported, including intermediate-term oncological endpoint and QoL, are similar for   RARC and ORC.",2
"Surgeons experience and institutional volume are considered the key factor for outcome of both   RARC and ORC, not the technique.",2
