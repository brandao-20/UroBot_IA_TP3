"11.5	  Length of follow-up after urethral surgery  The median time of recurrence after bulbar urethroplasty is approximately ten months [334]. In case series,   between 55.4% [587] and 96% [569, 572] of all recurrences are detected during the first year of follow-up after   urethral surgery. Twenty-three percent of bulbar stricture recurrences are detected during the second year of   follow-up, and the percentage of recurrences decreases after the second year [346].",
Summary of evidence,LE
Retrograde urethrography and urethrocystoscopy are able to identify anatomical success after a   urethroplasty.,2a
A significant gap was demonstrated between objective and subjective outcomes after urethroplasties.   PROM questionnaires are specific tools to assess subjective outcomes and patient satisfaction after   urethroplasty surgeries.,2a
Validated questionnaires proved useful to assess the consequences of urethral surgery on sexual function.,2a
