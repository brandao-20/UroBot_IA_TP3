Bosniak   category,Features,Work-up
I,"Simple benign cyst with a hairline-thin wall without septa, calcification,   or solid components. Same density as water and does not enhance with   contrast medium.",Benign
II,"Benign cyst that may contain a few hairline-thin septa. Fine calcification   may be present in the wall or septa. Uniformly high-attenuation lesions    < 3 cm in size, with sharp margins without enhancement.",Benign
IIF,"These may contain more hairline-thin septa. Minimal enhancement of   a hairline-thin septum or wall. Minimal thickening of the septa or wall.   The cyst may contain calcification, which may be nodular and thick,   with no contrast enhancement. No enhancing soft-tissue elements.   This category also includes totally intra-renal, non-enhancing, high   attenuation renal lesions > 3 cm. Generally well-marginated.","Follow-up, up to   five years. Some are   malignant."
III,These are indeterminate cystic masses with thickened irregular walls or   septa with enhancement.,Surgery or AS â€“ see   Chapter 7. Over 50%   are malignant.
