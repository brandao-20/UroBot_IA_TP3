"Table 4.1: UICC/AJCC 8th edition TNM clinical and pathological classification of penile cancer [73, 83]"
Clinical classification
T - Primary Tumour
TX   Primary tumour cannot be assessed  T0   No evidence of primary tumour  Tis   Carcinoma in situ (Penile Intraepithelial Neoplasia â€“ PeIN)  Ta   Non-invasive verrucous carcinoma*  T1   Tumour invades subepithelial connective tissue  T1a   Tumour invades subepithelial connective tissue without lymphovascular invasion or perineural   invasion and is not poorly differentiated  T1b   Tumour invades subepithelial connective tissue with lymphovascular invasion or perineural   invasion or is poorly differentiated  T2  Tumour invades corpus spongiosum with or without invasion of the urethra   T3  Tumour invades corpus cavernosum with or without invasion of the urethra  T4  Tumour invades other adjacent structures
N - Regional Lymph Nodes
"cNX  Regional lymph nodes cannot be assessed  cN0   No palpable or visibly enlarged inguinal lymph nodes  cN1   Palpable mobile unilateral inguinal lymph node  cN2   Palpable mobile multiple or bilateral inguinal lymph nodes  cN3   Fixed inguinal nodal mass or pelvic lymphadenopathy, unilateral or bilateral"
M - Distant Metastasis
cM0   No distant metastasis  cM1   Distant metastasis
Pathological classification
The pT categories correspond to the clinical T categories.   The pN categories are based upon biopsy or surgical excision
pN - Regional Lymph Nodes
"pNX  Regional lymph nodes cannot be assessed  pN0   No regional lymph node metastasis  pN1   Metastasis in one or two inguinal lymph nodes  pN2   Metastasis in more than two unilateral inguinal nodes or bilateral inguinal lymph nodes  pN3   Metastasis in pelvic lymph node(s), unilateral or bilateral or extranodal extension of regional lymph   node metastasis"
pM - Distant Metastasis
pM1   Distant metastasis microscopically confirmed
G - Histopathological Grading
GX   Grade of differentiation cannot be assessed  G1   Well differentiated  G2   Moderately differentiated  G3  Poorly differentiated   G4  Undifferentiated
