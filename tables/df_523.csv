Table 7.1: Management of neobladder morbidity (30-64%) [392],,,
CLAVIEN   System,,Morbidity  Management,
Grade I,"Any deviation from the normal  post-operative course without  the need for pharmacological  treatment or surgical, endoscopic   and radiological interventions.  Allowed therapeutic regimens  are: drugs such as antiemetics,  antipyretics, analgesics,  diuretics and electrolytes and  physiotherapy.  This grade also includes wound  infections opened at the bedside.",Immediate complications:,
,,Post-operative ileus,Nasogastric intubation (usually   removed at day 1)  Chewing gum  Avoid fluid excess and   hypovolemia (provoke   splanchnic hypoperfusion)
,,Post-operative nausea   and vomiting,Antiemetic agent    (decrease opioids)  Nasogastric intubation
,,Urinary infection,"Antibiotics, no ureteral catheter   removal  Check the 3 drainages (ureters   and neobladdder)"
,,Ureteral catheter   obstruction,Inject 5 cc saline in the   ureteral catheter to resolve the   obstruction  Increase volume infusion to   increase diuresis
,,Intra-abdominal urine   leakage (anastomosis   leakage),"Check and reposition drainages,   if needed"
,,Anaemia well tolerated,Martial treatment    (give iron supplement)
,,Late complications:,
,,Non compressive   lymphocele,Watchful waiting
,,Mucus cork,Catheterise and rinse the   bladder
,,Incontinence,"Urine analysis (infection),   echography (post-void residual)  Physiotherapy"
,,Retention,Drainage and self-  catheterisation education
,,Ureteral reflux,No treatment if asymptomatic
Grade II,Requiring pharmacological  treatment with drugs other  than those allowed for grade I  complications. Blood transfusions   and total parenteral nutrition are   also included.,Anaemia badly tolerated   or if myocardial   cardiopathy history,Transfusion1
,,Pulmonary embolism,Heparinotherapy2
,,Pyelonephritis,Antibiotics and check kidney   drainage  (nephrostomy if necessary)
,,Confusion or neurological   disorder,Neuroleptics and avoid opioids
Grade III,"Requiring surgical, endoscopic or   radiological intervention",Ureteral catheter   accidentally dislodged,Reposition the ureteral catheter
,,Anastomosis stenosis   (7%),Renal drainage (ureteral   catheter or nephrostomy)
III-a,Intervention not under general   anaesthesia,Compressive lymphocele,Transcutaneous drainage
III-b,Intervention under general   anaesthesia,Ileal anastomosis leakage,"Ileostomy, as soon as possible"
,,Evisceration,Surgery in emergency
,,Compressive lymphocele,Surgery (marsupialisation)
Grade IV,"Life-threatening complication   (including central nervous   system complications: brain   haemorrhage, ischaemic stroke,   subarachnoid bleeding, but   excluding transient ischaemic   attacks) requiring intensive care/   intensive care unit management.",Neobladder rupture,Nephrostomy and indwelling   catheter/surgery for draining the   neobladder
,,Severe sepsis,Antibiotics and check all the   urinary drainages and CT scan   in emergency
IV-a,Single organ dysfunction,Non-obstructive renal   failure,Bicarbonate/aetiology treatment   (including dialysis)
IV-b,Multi-organ dysfunction,Obstructive pyelonephritis   and septicaemia,"Treatment at intensive care unit,   including urinary drainage and   antibiotics"
Grade V,Death of a patient,,
Suffix ‘d’,"If the patient suffers from a complication at the time of discharge, the suffix “d” (for ‘disability’)   is added to the respective grade of complication. This label indicates the need for a follow-up to   fully evaluate the complication.",,
