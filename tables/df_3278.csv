Table 56: Fertilisation methods for male factor and non-male factor infertility (adapted from [2271]),
Fertilisation method,
Male Factor Infertility,
Sperm derived from men with azoospermia,ICSI mandatory
Severe OAT,ICSI highly recommended
Moderate OAT,IVF and ICSI equally effective
Isolated teratozoospermia,IVF and ICSI equally effective
Absolute asthenozoospermia,ICSI mandatory
Globozoospermia,ICSI mandatory
Anti-sperm antibodies,IVF and ICSI equally effective
Sperm DNA fragmentation,ICSI recommended
Non-male factor infertility,
Unexplained infertility,"Equally effective. Couples should be informed that   ICSI improves fertilisation rates compared to IVF   alone, but once fertilisation is achieved the pregnancy   rate is no better than with IVF.  It should be noted for clarification that in the absence   of male factors, ICSI should not be offered in the first   treatment cycle [2275]."
General non-male factor population,"Equally effective, slightly in favour of IVF"
Poor quality oocytes and advanced maternal age,"Equally effective, slightly in favour of IVF"
Pre-implantation genetic testing,ICSI highly recommended
Poor responders,"Equally effective, slightly in favour of IVF"
Tubal ligation,IVF preferable
Sero-discordant couples,Equally effective
