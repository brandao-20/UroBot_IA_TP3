Summary of evidence and guidelines for staging of prostate cancer,,,,,,,
Recommendations  Strength rating,,,,,,,
Any risk group staging,,,,,,,
Use pre-biopsy MRI for local staging information.  Weak,,,,,,,
"Treatment should not be changed based on PSMA PET/CT findings, in view of current   Strong  available data.",,,,,,,
Low-risk localised disease,,,,,,,
Do not use additional imaging for staging purposes.   Strong,,,,,,,
Intermediate-risk disease,,,,,,,
"Weak  In ISUP grade 3, include at least cross-sectional abdominopelvic imaging and a bone-scan   for metastatic screening.",,,,,,,
High-risk localised disease/locally-advanced disease,,,,,,,
Perform metastatic screening including at least cross-sectional abdominopelvic imaging   Strong  and a bone-scan.,,,,,,,
"When using PSMA-PET or whole body MRI to increase sensitivity, be aware of the lack of   Strong  outcome data of subsequent treatment changes.",,,,,,,
