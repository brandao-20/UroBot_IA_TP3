"4.13.1	  Recommendations for investigations for the assessment of patients with stones of unknown   composition [21, 27, 68, 627]",
Recommendations,Strength rating
Use ultrasound (US) as first-line imaging with symptoms suggestive of a bladder stone.,Strong
"Use cystoscopy or computed tomography (CT), or kidney-ureter-bladder X-Ray (KUB) to   investigate adults with persistent symptoms suggestive of a bladder stone if US is negative.",Strong
Use X-Ray KUB for adults with confirmed bladder stones to guide treatment options and   follow-up.,Weak
"All patients with bladder stones should be examined and investigated for the cause of   bladder stone formation, including:  •   uroflowmetry and post-void residual;  •   urine dipstick, pH, ± culture;  •   metabolic assessment and stone analysis (see sections 3.3.2.3 and 4.1 of the   Urolithiasis guidelines for further details).  In selected patients, consider:  •   upper tract imaging (in patients with a history of urolithiasis or loin pain);  •   cysto-urethroscopy or urethrogram.",Weak
Offer oral chemolitholysis for radiolucent or known uric acid bladder stones in adults.,Weak
Offer adults with bladder stones transurethral cystolithotripsy where possible.,Strong
"Perform transurethral cystolithotripsy with a continuous flow instrument in adults (e.g.,   nephroscope or resectoscope) where possible.",Weak
Offer adults percutaneous cystolithotripsy where transurethral cystolithotripsy is not   possible or advisable.,Strong
Suggest open cystolithotomy as an option for very large bladder stones in adults and   children.,Weak
Offer children with bladder stones transurethral cystolithotripsy where possible.,Weak
"Offer children percutaneous cystolithotripsy where transurethral cystolithotripsy is not   possible or is associated with a high risk of urethral stricture (e.g., young children, previous   urethral reconstruction, and spinal cord injury).",Weak
"Open, laparoscopic, and extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy are alternative treatments   where endoscopic treatment is not advisable in adults and children.",Weak
"Prefer “tubeless” procedure (without placing a catheter or drain) for children with primary   bladder stones and no prior infection, surgery, or bladder dysfunction where open   cystolithotomy is indicated.",Weak
"Individualise imaging follow up for each patient as there is a paucity of evidence.   Factors affecting follow up will include:  •   whether the underlying functional predisposition to stone formation can be treated (e.g.,   TURP);  •   metabolic risk.",Weak
"Recommend regular irrigation therapy with saline solution to adults and children with   bladder augmentation, continent cutaneous urinary reservoir or neuropathic bladder   dysfunction, and no history of autonomic dysreflexia, to reduce the risk of stone recurrence.",Weak
