Recommendations,Strength rating
Urachal remnants (URs) with no epithelial tissue carry little risk of malignant transformation.,Strong
Asymptomatic and non-specific atretic urachal remnants can safely be managed non-  operatively.,Strong
Urachal remnants incidentally identified during diagnostic imaging for non-specific symptoms   should also be observed non-operatively since they tend to resolve spontaneously.,Strong
"A small UR, especially at birth, may be viewed as physiological.",Strong
Urachal remnants in patients younger than six months are likely to resolve with non-  operative management.,Strong
Follow-up is necessary only when symptomatic for six to twelve months.,Strong
Surgical excision of URs solely as a preventive measure against later malignancy appears to   have minimal support in the literature.,Strong
Only symptomatic URs should be safely removed by open or laparoscopic approach.,Strong
A voiding cystourethogram is only recommended when presenting with febrile urinary tract   infection.,
