4.2.4.3.2.5.1  Summary of evidence and recommendations for mid-urethral slings,
Summary of evidence,LE
"The retropubic MUS appears to provide better patient-reported subjective and objective cure of SUI,   compared with colposuspension.",1a
Synthetic MUSs inserted by the transobturator or retropubic route provide equivalent patient-reported   outcomes at one year.,1a
Synthetic MUSs inserted by the retropubic route have higher patient-reported cure rates in the longer   term.,1b
Long-term analyses of MUS cohorts showed a sustained response beyond 10 years.,2b
"The retropubic route of insertion, compared with the transobturator route, is associated with a higher   intraoperative risk of bladder perforation and a higher rate of voiding dysfunction.",1a
The transobturator route of insertion is associated with a higher risk of groin pain than the retropubic   route.,1a
Long-term analysis of MUS showed no difference in terms of efficacy for the skin-to-vagina (outside-  in) compared to vagina-to-skin (inside-out) directions up to nine years.,2a
The top-to-bottom (inside-out) direction in the retropubic approach is associated with a higher risk of   postoperative voiding dysfunction.,1b
The comparative efficacy of Ajust® and Altis® single-incision slings against conventional MUS at   fifteen and 36 months is non-inferior.,1b
Operating times for insertion of single-incision MUSs are shorter than for standard retropubic slings.,1b
Blood loss and immediate postoperative pain are lower for insertion of single-incision slings compared   with conventional MUS.,1b
"The rate of mesh exposure, repeat SUI surgery and dyspareunia at 3 years is higher for single-incision   slings (Ajust® and Alits®) compared to conventional MUS.",1b
There is no evidence that other adverse outcomes from surgery are more or less likely with single-  incision slings than with conventional MUS.,1b
"In women undergoing surgery for SUI, coital incontinence is likely to improve.",3
"Overall, there is conflicting evidence regarding sexual function following SUI surgery.",1a
Recommendations,Strength rating
Offer a mid-urethral sling (MUS) to women seeking surgical treatment for stress urinary   incontinence following a thorough discussion of the risks and benefits relative to other   surgical modalities.,Strong
Inform women that long-term outcomes from MUS inserted by the retropubic route are   superior to those inserted via the transobturator route.,Strong
Inform women of the complications associated with MUS procedures and discuss all   alternative treatments in the light of recent publicity surrounding surgical mesh.,Strong
"Inform women who are being offered single-incision slings (Ajust® and Altis®), that short   term efficacy appears equivalent compared to conventional MUS.",Strong
Inform women who are being offered a single-incision sling that long-term efficacy remains   uncertain.,Strong
