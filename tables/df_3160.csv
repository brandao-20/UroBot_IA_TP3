3.5.4	  Summary of evidence and recommendations for the diagnostic evaluation of LOH,
Summary of evidence,LE
Sexual symptoms are the most specific symptoms associated with LOH.,1a
"Diagnosis of LOH should be based on specific signs and symptoms of androgen deficiency, together   with consistently low serum testosterone levels.",1a
12 nmol/L total testosterone (3.5 ng/mL) represents a reliable threshold to diagnose LOH.,1a
"Functional hypogonadism is a consequence of comorbidity/concomitant drugs, which can impair   testosterone production in adulthood. The diagnosis of functional hypogonadism is a diagnosis of   exclusion, after ruling out organic causes of hypogonadism.",4
