"11.5.2.1.4	 Alcohol consumption   Data derived from a recent meta-analysis including 15 cross-sectional studies and 16,395 men suggested   that moderate alcohol does not adversely affect semen parameters, whereas high alcohol intake can have a   detrimental effect on male fertility [2114]. Similar to what has been reported for weight loss; however, heavy   chronic alcohol consumption (defined as > 2 drinks/day [2115]) can reduce testosterone levels, which can be   restored by alcohol cessation [2116].",

"Treat hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (secondary hypogonadism), including congenital   causes, with combined human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) and follicle-stimulating   hormone (FSH) (recombinant FSH; highly purified FSH) or pulsed Gonadotropin-releasing   hormone (GnRH) via pump therapy to stimulate spermatogenesis.",Strong
Induce spermatogenesis by an effective drug therapy (hCG; human menopausal   gonadotropins; recombinant FSH; highly purified FSH) in men with hypogonadotropic   hypogonadism.,Strong
The use of GnRH therapy is more expensive and does not offer any advantages when   compared to gonadotropins for the treatment of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism.,Strong
"Use FSH treatment in men with idiopathic oligozoospermia and FSH values within the   normal range, to ameliorate spermatogenesis outcomes.",Weak
No conclusive recommendations can be given on the use of high-dose FSH in men with   idiopathic infertility and prior (m)TESE and therefore cannot be routinely advocated.,Weak
Do not use testosterone therapy for the treatment of male infertility.,Strong
Provide testosterone therapy for symptomatic patients with primary and secondary   hypogonadism who are not considering parenthood.,Strong
"In the presence of hyperprolactinaemia, dopamine agonist therapy may improve   spermatogenesis.",Weak
