Laparoscopy,"[2008, 2041,   2042, 2057,   2058]",3-6,"Hydrocele (7-43%)   epididymitis,   wound infection,   testicular atrophy due to   injury of testicular artery,   bleeding","External spermatic vein   ligation failure, intestinal,   vascular and nerve damage;   pulmonary embolism;   pneumo-scrotum;   peritonitis; post-operative   pain in right shoulder (due   to diaphragmatic stretching   during pneumo-peritoneum)"
Summary of evidence,LE,,,
The presence of varicocele in some men is associated with progressive testicular damage from   adolescence onwards and a consequent reduction in fertility.,2a,,,
"Although the treatment of varicocele in adolescents may be effective, there is a significant risk of over-  treatment as the majority of boys with a varicocele will have no fertility problems later in life.",3,,,
"Varicocele repair may be effective in men with abnormal semen parameters, a clinical varicocele and   otherwise unexplained male factor infertility.",1a,,,
"Although there are no prospective randomised studies evaluating this, meta-analyses have suggested   that varicocele repair leads to sperm appearing in the ejaculate of men with non-obstructive   azoospermia.",2,,,
"Microscopic approach (inguinal/subinguinal) may have lower recurrence and complications rates than   non-microscopic approaches (retroperitoneal and laparoscopic), although no RCTs are available yet.",2a,,,
Varicocele is associated with raised DNA fragmentation and intervention has been shown to reduce   DNA fragmentation.,2a,,,
Recommendations,Strength rating,,,
Treat varicocele in adolescents with ipsilateral reduction in testicular volume and evidence   of progressive testicular dysfunction.,Weak,,,
Do not treat varicocele in infertile men who have normal semen analysis and in men with a   sub-clinical varicocele.,Weak,,,
"Treat infertile men with a clinical varicocele, abnormal semen parameters and otherwise   unexplained infertility in a couple where the female partner has good ovarian reserve to   improve fertility rates.",Strong,,,
"Varicocelectomy may be considered in men with raised DNA fragmentation with otherwise   unexplained infertility or who have suffered from failed of assisted reproductive techniques,   including recurrent pregnancy loss, failure of embryogenesis and implantation.",Weak,,,
