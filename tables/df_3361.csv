"5.7	  Impact on fertility and fertility-associated issues  Sperm abnormalities and Leydig cell dysfunction are frequently found in patients with TCs prior to   orchidectomy [89, 90]. Up to 24% of TC patients are azoospermic and almost 50% have abnormal sperm   counts (oligozo-ospemic) before treatment [90].",
Summary of evidence,LE
"Poor sperm quality is frequently found in TC patients, before and after treatment. Semen preservation   is the most cost-effective strategy for fertility preservation.",2b
"Serum tumour markers (AFP, Î²-hCG and LDH) should be determined before and after orchidectomy   and throughout follow-up. They are used for accurate staging, risk stratification, to monitor treatment   and to detect relapse.",2b
"For abdominal staging, CECT has a median sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV and accuracy of 67%,   95%, 87%, 73% and 83%, respectively. Sensitivity decreases and specificity increases with increasing   lymph node size.",2a
"For chest staging, CECT has a median sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV and accuracy of 100%, 93%,   68%, 100% and 93%, respectively.",2a
"Magnetic resonance imaging and CECT are key image modalities for the detection of brain metastasis.   Magnetic resonance imaging is far more sensitive than CECT, though it does require expertise.",2b
Fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography has a limited diagnostic accuracy for staging   before chemotherapy.,2b
There are no high-level evidence studies supporting screening programs.,2b
"In TSS, FSE has shown to be reliable and highly concordant with final histopathology.",1b
There is no evidence supporting any size criteria for a testicular lesion to be safely followed-up.,2b
"In patients without risk factors, there is low incidence of contralateral GCNIS and of metachronous GCT.",2b
