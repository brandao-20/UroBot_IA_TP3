5.1.7	  Summary of evidence and guidelines for the primary assessment of presumably invasive   bladder tumours,
Recommendations,Strength rating
"Describe all macroscopic features of the tumour (site, size, number and appearance) and   mucosal abnormalities during cystoscopy. Use a bladder diagram.",Strong
"Take a biopsy of the prostatic urethra in cases of bladder neck tumour, when bladder   carcinoma in situ is present or suspected, when there is positive cytology without evidence   of tumour in the bladder, or when abnormalities of the prostatic urethra are visible.",Strong
"In men with a negative prostatic urethral biopsy undergoing subsequent orthotopic   neobladder construction, an intra-operative frozen section can be omitted.",Strong
"In men with a prior positive transurethral prostatic biopsy, subsequent orthotopic   neobladder construction should not be denied a priori, unless an intra-operative frozen   section of the distal urethral stump reveals malignancy at the level of urethral dissection.",Strong
"In women undergoing subsequent orthotopic neobladder construction, obtain procedural   information (including histological evaluation) of the bladder neck and urethral margin, either   prior to, or at the time of cystectomy.",Strong
"In the pathology report, specify the grade, depth of tumour invasion, and whether the   lamina propria and muscle tissue are present in the specimen.",Strong
