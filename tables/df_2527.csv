7.1.4.3.8  Summary of evidence and recommendations for therapeutic approaches as alternative to surgery,
Summary of evidence,LE
Most population-based analyses show a significantly lower CSM for patients treated with surgery   compared to non-surgical management.,3
"In AS cohorts, the growth of SRMs is low in most cases and progression to metastatic disease is rare   (1â€“2%).",3
Low-quality studies suggest higher disease recurrence rates after RFA of tumours > 3 cm and after   cryoablation of tumours > 4 cm.,3
"Low-quality studies suggest a higher local recurrence rate for TA therapies compared to PN, but   quality of data does not allow definitive conclusions.",3
Recommendations,Strength rating
Offer active surveillance (AS) or thermal ablation (TA) to frail and/or comorbid patients with   small renal masses.,Weak
"Perform a percutaneous renal mass biopsy prior to, and not concomitantly with, TA.",Strong
"When TA or AS are offered, discuss with patients about the harms/benefits with regards to   oncological outcomes and complications.",Strong
Do not routinely offer TA for tumours > 3 cm and cryoablation for tumours > 4 cm.,Weak
