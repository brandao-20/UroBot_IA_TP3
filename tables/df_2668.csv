"3.1.10.2	  Mycophenolates (MPA)  The mycophenolates, MMF and EC-MPS, are based on mycophenolic acid, which inhibits inosine   monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) [283-287]. This is the rate-limiting step for the synthesis of guanosine   monophosphate in the de novo purine pathway. As the function and proliferation of lymphocytes is more   dependent on de novo purine nucleotide synthesis compared to other cell types, IMPDH inhibitors may provide   more specific lymphocyte-targeted immunosuppression. The co-administration of MPA with prednisolone and   CNI has resulted in a profound reduction of biopsy-proven rejections [242, 245, 283-287]. Mycophenolic acid is   not nephrotoxic; however, it inhibits bone marrow function and may cause CMV infections and gastrointestinal   side effects, particularly diarrhoea [242, 245, 283-287]. There is also a higher incidence of polyoma   nephropathy, especially when mycophenolate is combined with tacrolimus [288].",
Recommendations,Strength rating
Use calcineurin inhibitors for rejection prophylaxis as they represent current best practice   pending publication of long-term results using newer agents.,Strong
Use tacrolimus as first-line calcineurin inhibitor due to its higher efficacy.,Strong
Monitor blood-levels of both cyclosporine and tacrolimus to allow appropriate dose   adjustment of calcineurin inhibitors.,Strong
