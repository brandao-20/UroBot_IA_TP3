Summary of evidence,LE,
"Non-contrast-enhanced CT is used to confirm stone diagnosis in patients with acute flank pain, as it is   superior to IVU.",1a,
"Enhanced CT enables 3D reconstruction of the collecting system, as well as measurement of stone   density and skin-to-stone distance.",2a,
Recommendations,Strength rating,
"Immediate imaging is indicated with fever or solitary kidney, and when diagnosis is doubtful.",Strong,
Use non-contrast-enhanced computed tomography to confirm stone diagnosis in patients   with acute flank pain following initial ultrasound assessment.,Strong,
Perform a contrast study if stone removal is planned and the anatomy of the renal collecting   system needs to be assessed.,Strong,
