Subtype  Frequency   Mortality   Other features  (% of cases)  (%),,,
HPV-independent SCC,,,
Usual,45 – 75,20 – 38,Diagnosis of exclusion. Various degrees of differentiation
Pseudohyperplastic*,< 1,0,"Well-differentiated, superficially spreading simulating   pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia"
Pseudoglandular*,< 1,30,Poorly-differentiated carcinoma with acantholytic   pseudolumina simulating glands
Verrucous,3 – 8,0,"Extremely well-differentiated, broad-based, and pushing   tumour front. No metastasis reported"
Cuniculatum,< 1,0,Endophytic labyrinthine growth pattern with broad-based   pushing margins.
Papillary,2 – 15,0 – 6,Papillae covered by well- to moderately differentiated cells   without koilocytes
Sarcomatoid,1 -7,45 – 90,Biphasic epithelial and spindle cell neoplasia. Most   aggressive and worse prognosis.
Mixed,10 – 19,3 – 7,Two or more subtypes in the same specimen. Prognosis is   related to the subtypes involved.
HPV-associated,,,
Basaloid,4 – 10,21 – 67,"Uniform basaloid cells in nests or sheets, with   comedonecrosis or abrupt keratinisation."
Warty,5 – 10,0 – 10,Condylomatous papillae with central fibrovascular cores and   koilocytes.
Clear cell,< 1,20 – 30,"Nests or sheets of cells with ample, clear cytoplasm with   central of geographical necrosis."
Lymphoepithelioma-  like,< 1,Unknown,Poorly differentiated cells intermixed with dense   lymphoplasmacytic and eosinophilic infiltrate.
Mixed,4 - 10,30 - 50,Mainly Warty-basaloid carcinoma according to the WHO 2022.
Others,,,
SCC NOS (not-  Unknown  Unknown  Keratinizing carcinoma. This must be used only when   otherwise specified)  evaluation of p16 is not available.,,,
Adenosquamous  1 – 2   0–14  Squamous tumour nests intermixed with a minor mucinous   glandular component.,,,
