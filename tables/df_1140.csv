4.6.4.1.1  Summary of evidence and recommendations for conservative management of nocturia,
Summary of evidence,LE
Individual or group PFMT appears to be equally effective for reduction in nocturia episodes.,1b
Most studies evaluating PFMT for nocturia in women with additional urinary symptoms have shown   positive results compared with placebo or anticholinergic drugs.,1b
Treatment of nocturia secondary to obstructive sleep apnoea with continuous positive airway pressure   reduces nocturia episodes.,1a
Recommendations,Strength rating
"Offer women with lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) lifestyle advice prior to, or concurrent   with, treatment.",Strong
Offer pelvic floor muscle training for nocturia (either individually or in the group setting) to   women with urinary incontinence or other storage LUTS.,Strong
Offer women with nocturia and a history suggestive of obstructive sleep apnoea a referral to   a sleep clinic for assessment of suitability for continuous positive airway pressure treatment.,Strong
Summary of evidence,LE
"Desmopressin treatment for nocturia shows significant reductions in nocturnal urine output, nocturnal   urinary frequency, and nocturnal polyuria index.",1b
"Most nocturia patients tolerate desmopressin treatment without clinically significant hyponatraemia;   however, the risk increases with increasing age and decreasing baseline serum sodium concentration.",1a
Treatment of nocturia in OAB patients with anticholinergic drugs shows reduction in nocturia episodes.,1b
Combination of PFMT and anticholinergics does not appear to confer additional benefit over   anticholinergics alone.,1b
