Urinary tract infection represents the most common bacterial infection in children less than 2 years of   age. The incidence varies depending on age and sex.,1b,
"Classifications are made according to the site, episode, severity, symptoms and complicating factors.   For acute treatment, site and severity are most important.",2b,
"The number of colony forming units (cfu) in the urine culture can vary, however, any colony count of   one specimen indicates a high suspicion for UTI.",2b,
"Due to increasing resistance numbers good antibiotic stewardship should guide the choice of   antibiotics, taking into account local resistance patterns, old urine cultures (when available) and   clinical parameters.",2a,
