"3.1.11.3	  Treatment of antibody mediated rejection (ABMR)  Treatment of ABMR relies mainly on retrospective studies and empirical treatment guidelines [367]. Consensus   is that it is important to classify the clinical and histological phenotype of the rejection in order to make   adequate treatment decisions [367]. Important clinical factors are time of rejection (early acute < 30 days      post-transplant vs. late), preformed vs. de novo donor-specific antibodies (DSA), and histology (active vs.   chronic rejection).",
Recommendations,Strength rating
Use steroid bolus therapy as first-line treatment for T-cell mediated rejection in addition to   ensuring adequate baseline immunosuppression.,Strong
"In severe or steroid-resistant rejection, use intensified immunosuppression, high-dose   steroid treatment, and eventually T-cell depleting agents.",Strong
