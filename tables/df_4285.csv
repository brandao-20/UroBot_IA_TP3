Table 4.2.2: Principles of surgical repair of ureteral injury,
Debridement of necrotic tissue,
Spatulation of ureteral ends,
Watertight tension-free mucosa-to-mucosa anastomosis using absorbable sutures,
Internal stenting,
External drain,
Isolation of injury with peritoneum or omentum,
Summary of evidence,LE
Iatrogenic ureteral trauma is the most common cause of ureteral injury.,3
"Gunshot wounds account for the majority of penetrating ureteral injuries, while road traffic accidents   account for most blunt injuries.",3
Ureteral trauma usually accompanies severe abdominal and pelvic injuries.,3
Haematuria is an unreliable and poor indicator of ureteral injury.,3
"Pre-operative prophylactic stents do not prevent ureteral injury; however, they may assist in its   detection.",2
Endo-urological treatment of small ureteral fistulae and strictures is safe and effective.,3
Major ureteral injury requires ureteral reconstruction following temporary urinary diversion.,3
Recommendations,Strength rating
Visually identify the ureters to prevent ureteral trauma during complex abdominal and pelvic   surgery.,Strong
"Beware of concomitant ureteral injury in all abdominal penetrating trauma, and in   deceleration-type blunt trauma.",Strong
Use pre-operative prophylactic stents in high-risk cases.,Strong
Repair iatrogenic ureteral injuries recognised during surgery immediately.,Strong
Treat iatrogenic ureteral injuries with delayed diagnosis by nephrostomy tube/JJ stent   urinary diversion.,Strong
Manage ureteral strictures by ureteral reconstruction according to the location and length of   the affected segment.,Strong
