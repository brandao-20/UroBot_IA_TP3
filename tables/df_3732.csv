Table 6.4: Results of visually controlled dilatation,,,,,,,,,
Recommendations,Strength rating,,,,,,,,
Do not use direct vision internal urethrotomy (DVIU) for penile strictures.,Strong,,,,,,,,
Do not use DVIU/dilatation as solitary treatment for long (> 2 cm) segment strictures.,Strong,,,,,,,,
"Perform DVIU/dilatation for a primary, single, short (< 2 cm) and non-obliterative stricture at   the bulbar urethra.",Weak,,,,,,,,
"Perform DVIU/dilatation for a short, veil-like recurrent stricture after prior bulbar   urethroplasty.",Weak,,,,,,,,
Use either “hot” or “cold knife” techniques to perform DVIU depending on operator   experience and resources.,Weak,,,,,,,,

Summary of evidence,LE,,,,,,,,
Visually controlled dilatation after endoscopic or fluoroscopic guidewire placement has a low   complication rate.,3,,,,,,,,
Repetitive dilatations/direct vision internal urethrotomy have no long-term freedom of recurrence and   increase stricture complexity.,1b,,,,,,,,
