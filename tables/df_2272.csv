Table 5.2: Risk of PCa identified by systemic PCa biopsy in relation to low PSA values [173],,
"Offer a risk-adapted strategy (based on initial PSA level), with follow-up intervals of 2 years   for those initially at risk:  •   men with a PSA level of > 1 ng/mL at 40 years of age;  •   men with a PSA level of > 2 ng/mL at 60 years of age;  Postpone follow-up up to 8 years in those not at risk.",Weak,
"In asymptomatic men with a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level between 3–10 ng/mL and   a normal digital rectal examination (DRE), repeat the PSA test prior to further investigations.",Weak,
"In asymptomatic men with a PSA level between 3–10 ng/mL and a normal DRE, use one of   the following tools for biopsy indication:  •   risk-calculator, provided it is correctly calibrated to the population prevalence;  •   magnetic resonance imaging of the prostate;",Strong,
"•   an additional serum, urine biomarker test.",Weak,
Stop early diagnosis of PCa based on life expectancy and performance status; men who   have a life-expectancy of < 15 years are unlikely to benefit.,Strong,
