"3.8.3	  Diagnostic evaluation  3.8.3.1	  Clinical diagnosis  Signs and systemic symptoms compatible with CA-UTI include new onset or worsening of fever, rigors, altered   mental status, malaise, or lethargy with no other identified cause, flank pain, costovertebral angle tenderness,   acute haematuria, pelvic discomfort and in those whose catheters have been removed dysuria, urgent or   frequent urination and suprapubic pain or tenderness [217]. In the catheterised patient, the presence or   absence of odorous or cloudy urine alone should not be used to differentiate CA-ABU from CA-UTI [217, 218].",
Summary of evidence,LE
"Patients with indwelling or suprapubic catheters become carriers of ABU, with antibiotic treatment   showing no benefit.",1a
"In the catheterised patient, the presence or absence of odorous or cloudy urine alone should not be   used to differentiate CA-ABU from CA-UTI.",2
Microbiologically CA-UTI is defined by microbial growth of > 103 cfu/mL of one or more bacterial   species in a single catheter urine specimen or in a mid-stream voided urine specimen from a patient   whose catheter has been removed within the previous 48 hours.,3
