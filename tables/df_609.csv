"3.5	  Urinary tract infection in neuro-urological patients  3.5.1	  Epidemiology, aetiology and pathophysiology  Urinary tract infection is the onset of signs and/or symptoms accompanied by laboratory findings of a UTI   (bacteriuria, leukocyturia and positive urine culture) [374]. There are no evidence-based cut-off values for the   quantification of these findings. The published consensus is that a significant bacteriuria in persons performing   IC is present with > 102 cfu/mL, > 104 cfu/mL in clean-void specimens and any detectable concentration   in suprapubic aspirates. Regarding leukocyturia, ten or more leukocytes in centrifuged urine samples per   microscopic field (400x) are regarded as significant [374].",
