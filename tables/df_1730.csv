3.6.7	  Summary of evidence and recommendations for the management of hypospadias,
Recommendations,Strength rating
"At birth, differentiate isolated hypospadias from disorders of sex development which are   mostly associated with cryptorchidism or micropenis.",Strong
"Counsel caregivers on functional indications for surgery, aesthetically feasible operative   procedures (psychological, cosmetic indications) and possible complications.",Strong
"In children diagnosed with proximal hypospadias and a small appearing penis, reduced   glans circumference or reduced urethral plate, pre-operative hormonal androgen stimulation   treatment is an option and the body of evidence to accentuate its harms and benefits is   inadequate.",Weak
"For distal hypospadias, offer Duplay-Thiersch urethroplasty, original and modified   tubularised incised plate urethroplasty; use the onlay urethroplasty or two-stage procedures   in more severe hypospadias. A treatment algorithm is presented (Figure 3). Correct   significant (> 30 degrees) curvature of the penis.",Weak
"Ensure long-term follow-up to detect urethral stricture, voiding dysfunctions and recurrent   penile curvature, ejaculation disorder, and to evaluate patientÂ´s satisfaction.",Strong
Use validated objective scoring systems to assist in evaluating the functional and cosmetic   outcome.,Strong
