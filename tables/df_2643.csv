"3.1.5	  Surgical approaches for first, second, third and further transplants  Transplant (bench/back-table) preparation is a crucial step in the transplantation process. The kidney must   be inspected whilst on a sterile ice slush, removing peri-nephric fat when possible to permit inspection of the   quality of the organ and to exclude exophytic renal tumours. Biopsy of the kidney on the back-table may be   performed to help in the multifactorial decision-making process regarding the quality and usage of the kidney   for both single and/or dual transplantation. Suspicious parenchymal lesions also require biopsy. Techniques for   intra-operative kidney biopsy are discussed in section 3.1.3.",
