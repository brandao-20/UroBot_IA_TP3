Summary of evidence,LE,,,
Stepwise power ramping prevents renal injury.,1b,,,
Clinical experience has shown that repeat sessions are feasible (within one day for ureteral stones).,4,,,
Optimal shock wave frequency is 1.0 to 1.5 Hz.,1a,,,
Proper acoustic coupling between the cushion of the treatment head and the patient’s skin is important.,2,,,
Careful imaging control of localisation of stone contributes to outcome of treatment.,2a,,,
Careful control of pain during treatment is necessary to limit pain-induced movements and excessive   respiratory excursions.,1a,,,
"Antibiotic prophylaxis is recommended in the case of internal stent placement, infected stones, or   bacteriuria.",1a,,,
Recommendations,Strength rating,,,
Ensure correct use of the coupling agent because this is crucial for effective shock wave   transportation.,Strong,,,
Maintain careful fluoroscopic and/or ultrasonographic monitoring during shock wave   lithotripsy (SWL).,Strong,,,
Use proper analgesia because it improves treatment results by limiting pain-induced   movements and excessive respiratory excursions.,Strong,,,
Prescribe antibiotics prior to SWL in the case of infected stones or bacteriuria.,Strong,,,
