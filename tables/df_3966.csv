3.4.15.8  Summary of evidence and recommendations for the management of stones in children,
Summary of evidence,LE
"In children, MET could increase the rate of stone expulsion, reduce the stone expulsion time, and   decrease pain episodes/analgesia demand, but it has a higher incidence of side effects.",1b
"In children, the indications for SWL, URS and PNL are similar to those in adults.",1b
Children with renal stones of a diameter up to 20 mm (~300 mm2) are ideal candidates for SWL.,1b
Ureteroscopy has become the treatment of choice for larger distal ureteral stones in children.,1a
"In children, the indications for PNL are similar to those in adults.",1a
MiniPNL is safe and effective in children.,1b
Recommendations,Strength rating
Offer children with single ureteral stones less than 10 mm shock wave lithotripsy (SWL) if   localisation is possible or ureteroscopy as first-line option.,Strong
Ureteroscopy is a feasible alternative for ureteral stones not amenable to SWL.,Strong
Offer children with renal stones with a diameter of up to 20 mm (~300 mm2) SWL.,Strong
Offer children with renal pelvic or calyceal stones with a diameter > 20 mm (~300 mm2)   percutaneous nephrolithotomy.,Strong
Retrograde renal surgery is a feasible alternative for renal stones smaller than 20 mm in all   locations.,Weak
