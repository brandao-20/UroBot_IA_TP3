"3.1.7.9	  Ureteral stenosis  Ureteral stenosis is a common complication in recipients, with an incidence of 0.6-10.5% [207]. Early   stenosis (within three months of surgery) is usually caused by surgical technique or compromised ureteral   blood supply during surgery. Late stenosis (after > six months) is provoked by infection, fibrosis, progressive   vascular disease and/or rejection [202, 208]. Clinically significant ureteral stricture should be considered when   persistent hydronephrosis on US occurs in association with impaired renal function. The first approach in the   management of stricture is the placement of a percutaneous nephrostomy tube with an antegrade pyelogram   [207]. The following treatment options depend mainly on the timing, recoverable kidney function, anatomy   of the stricture, patient body habitus/comorbidities, and surgeon preference. Strictures < 3 cm in length may   be treated endoscopically either with percutaneous balloon dilation or antegrade flexible ureteroscopy and   holmium laser incision. In this scenario the success rate approaches 50%; although, maximum success is   obtained for strictures < 1 cm [209-211]. In case of a recurrence after a primary endourological approach   and/or stricture > 3 cm in length, surgical reconstruction should be performed [208] including direct ureteral   re-implantation, pyelo-vesical re-implantation (with or without psoas hitch and/or Boari Flap) or in cases with a   normal native ureter, uretero-ureterostomy [212, 213]. Long-term graft and patient survival are not significantly   affected [214].",
