9.3.2.4.4  Summary of evidence and recommendations for penile girth enhancement,
Summary of evidence,LE
"Various surgical approaches with specific outcomes and complications have been considered to   address penile girth enhancement, with limited benefit.",3
"Hyaluronic acid (HA), Poly-l-lactic acid (PLA), hydroxyethyl methacrylate, polyalkylamide hydrogel   (PAAG), polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA), calcium hydroxyapatite are used as injectable materials for   penile girth enhancement.",3
"Patient satisfaction with soft tissue fillers (especially HA, PMMA and PLA) is high (> 78%).",3
No complications other than temporary local pain and swelling were reported in patients treated with   soft tissue fillers.,3
"Using silicone, paraffin and petroleum jelly (Vaseline) in penile girth enhancement causes a range of   complications ranging from oedema to infection to Fournier’s gangrene.",3
Not enough long-term data are available on autologous fat injection for penile girth enhancement.,4
"Not enough long-term data are available on grafting procedures (dermal acellular matrix graft, venous   grafts or dermal fat grafts).",4
Grafting procedures are associated with a high complication rate and low rate of patient’s satisfaction.,3
Not enough long term data are available on biodegradable scaffolds and subcutaneous penile implant   (Penuma®) .,4
