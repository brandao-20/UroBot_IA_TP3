"4.1	  Staging  The Tumour Node Metastasis (TNM) classification system is recommended for clinical and scientific use [82].   A supplement was published in 2012, and the latter’s prognostic value was confirmed in single- and multi-  institution studies [83, 84]. Tumour size, venous invasion, renal capsular invasion, adrenal involvement, and LN   and distant metastasis are included in the TNM classification system (Table 4.1). However, some uncertainties   remain:  •	  The sub-classification of T1 tumours using a cut-off of 4 cm might not be optimal in NSS for localised cancer;  •	  The value of size stratification of T2 tumours has been questioned [85];  •	  Renal sinus fat invasion might carry a worse prognosis than perinephric fat invasion, but, is nevertheless   included in the same pT3a stage group [86-89] (LE: 3);  •	  Sub T-stages (pT2b, pT3a, pT3c and pT4) may overlap [84];  •	  For adequate M staging, accurate pre-operative imaging (chest and abdominal CT) should be performed      [90, 91] (LE: 4).",
Summary of evidence,LE
A variety of renal tumours exist of which approximately 15% are benign.,1b
"The most common renal tumours are three malignant types of RCC (clear cell, papillary and   chromophobe) and two benign renal tumours: oncocytoma and angiomyolipoma.",3
"A definitive histopathological diagnosis of oncocytoma cannot be made on a needle-core biopsy,   because chRCC can show intratumoural heterogeneity with areas very similar to oncocytoma.",3
Recent histological work up and results of AS of Bosniak III cysts shows low risk of malignant   potential/course.,2
