Local salvage treatment   Strength rating,,,,,,
Recommendations for biochemical recurrence (BCR) after radical prostatectomy,,,,,,
"Offer monitoring, including prostate-specific antigen (PSA), to EAU Low-Risk BCR patients.  Weak",,,,,,
Offer early salvage intensity-modulated radiotherapy/volumetric arc radiation therapy plus   image-guided radiotherapy to men with two consecutive PSA rises.,Strong,,,,,
"A negative positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) scan should not   delay salvage radiotherapy (SRT), if otherwise indicated.",Strong,,,,,
"Do not wait for a PSA threshold before starting treatment. Once the decision for SRT has   been made, SRT (at least 64 Gy) should be given as soon as possible.",Strong,,,,,
Offer hormonal therapy in addition to SRT to men with BCR.,Weak,,,,,
Recommendations for BCR after radiotherapy,,,,,,
"Offer monitoring, including PSA to EAU Low-Risk BCR patients.",Weak,,,,,
"Only offer salvage radical prostatectomy (RP), brachytherapy, stereotactic body   radiotherapy, high-intensity focused ultrasound, or cryosurgical ablation to highly selected   patients with biopsy-proven local recurrence within a clinical trial setting or well-designed   prospective cohort study undertaken in experienced centres.",Strong,,,,,
Recommendations for systemic salvage treatment,,,,,,
Do not offer androgen deprivation therapy to M0 patients with a PSA-doubling time    Strong  > 12 months.,,,,,,
Recommendations for follow-up after radical prostatectomy or radiotherapy,,,,,,
Routinely follow-up asymptomatic patients by obtaining at least a disease-specific history   Strong  and serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) measurement.,,,,,,
"At recurrence, only perform imaging if the result will affect treatment planning.  Strong",,,,,,
