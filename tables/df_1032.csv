"3.5	  Post-void residual volume  Post-void residual (PVR) volume is the amount of urine that remains in the bladder after voiding. It is a measure   of voiding efficiency, and results from a number of contributing factors. The detection of significant PVR volume   is important because it may worsen symptoms and, may be associated with UTI, upper urinary tract (UUT)   dilatation and renal insufficiency. Both bladder outlet obstruction (BOO) and/or detrusor underactivity (DU)   can potentially contribute to the development of significant PVR volume. Post-void residual volume can be   measured by catheterisation or ultrasound (US).",
Summary of evidence,LE
Urinalysis negative for nitrite and leukocyte esterase may exclude bacteriuria in women with LUTS.,3
"Urinary incontinence may be a symptom during UTI, and LUTS may increase during UTI.",3
The presence of UTI worsens existing symptoms of UI.,3
Elderly nursing home patients with UI do not benefit from treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria.,2
