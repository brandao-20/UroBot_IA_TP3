"8.1.2	  Diagnostic evaluation  Taking a medical and sexual history is usually sufficient to establish a diagnosis of CPC. Patients usually   present after reaching puberty as the curvature becomes more apparent with erections, and more severe   curvatures can make intercourse difficult or impossible. Physical examination and photographic documentation   during erection (preferably after intracavernous injection [ICI] of vasoactive drugs) are both mandatory to   document the curvature and exclude other pathologies [1020].",

Medical and sexual history are usually sufficient to establish a diagnosis of CPC. Physical examination   and photographic documentation during erection (preferably after intracavernous injection [ICI] of   vasoactive drugs) are both mandatory to document the curvature,3
"There is no role for medical management of CPC. Surgery is the only treatment option, which can be   deferred until after puberty and can be performed at any time in adult life in individuals with significant   functional impairment during intercourse.",3
