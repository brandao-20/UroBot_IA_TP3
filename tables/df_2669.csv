"3.1.10.2	  Mycophenolates (MPA)  The mycophenolates, MMF and EC-MPS, are based on mycophenolic acid, which inhibits inosine   monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) [283-287]. This is the rate-limiting step for the synthesis of guanosine   monophosphate in the de novo purine pathway. As the function and proliferation of lymphocytes is more   dependent on de novo purine nucleotide synthesis compared to other cell types, IMPDH inhibitors may provide   more specific lymphocyte-targeted immunosuppression. The co-administration of MPA with prednisolone and   CNI has resulted in a profound reduction of biopsy-proven rejections [242, 245, 283-287]. Mycophenolic acid is   not nephrotoxic; however, it inhibits bone marrow function and may cause CMV infections and gastrointestinal   side effects, particularly diarrhoea [242, 245, 283-287]. There is also a higher incidence of polyoma   nephropathy, especially when mycophenolate is combined with tacrolimus [288].",
Summary of evidence,LE
The co-administration of MPA with prednisolone and CNI has resulted in a profound reduction of   biopsy-proven rejections.,1
"Both MPA formulations, MMF and EC-MPS, are equally effective with an almost identical safety   profile.",1
Due to a higher incidence of CMV disease with MPA either CMV prophylaxis or a pre-emptive strategy   with regular screening for CMV viraemia should be instituted.,1
