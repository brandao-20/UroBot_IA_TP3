"3.1.5.2	  Robot-assisted kidney transplant surgery  Robot-assisted kidney transplant (RAKT) surgery using living donor kidneys has been evaluated in multi-centre   prospective non-randomised studies (using IDEAL consortium principles) [126]. Single-centre prospective non-  randomised studies are on-going addressing RAKT with use of deceased donor kidneys. Both trans- and   extra-peritoneal approaches for RAKT are described. Potential advantages of RAKT may exist (decreased post-  operative pain, incision length and lymphocele rate). Potential issues with RAKT are the exclusion of recipients   with severe atherosclerosis or third (or further) kidney transplants, a higher than expected rate of DGF and a   small number of reported early arterial thromboses despite carefully selected cases [127]. The learning curve for   RAKT has been reported to be 35 cases for experienced surgeons in a retrospective multicentre series of 187   patients undergoing RAKT [128]. Complication and DGF rates decreased significantly and plateaued after the first      20 cases. The rate of Clavien-Dindo grade III/IV complications was 14% during the first ten RAKTs, but only 3%   after this [128]. The rate of arterial graft thrombosis (1.6%) was comparable with that for open kidney transplant   (0.5 - 3.5%) [128]. A ten year single-centre retrospective analysis of 239 obese RAKT patients concluded that   RAKT can be safely performed in obese patients with minimal risk of developing a surgical site infection [129]. A   graft failure rate of 7.1% was reported during follow-up mostly due to acute rejection. Patient and graft survival   was 95% and 93% at three years, respectively [129]. Evidence is too premature to recommend RAKT outside of   appropriately mentored prospective studies.",
Recommendations,Strength rating
Use the external or common iliac arteries for an end-to-side arterial anastomosis to donor   renal artery.,Weak
Use an end-to-end anastomosis to the internal iliac artery as an alternative to external or   common iliac arteries.,Weak
Check the intima of the donor and recipient arteries prior to commencing the arterial   anastomosis to ensure that there is no intimal rupture/flap. If this is found it must be   repaired prior to/as part of the arterial anastomosis.,Strong
"Pre-operatively plan the surgical approach in third or further transplants, to ensure that   appropriate arterial inflow and venous outflow exists with adequate space to implant the   new kidney.",Strong
