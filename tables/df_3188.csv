9.2.1.5	  Counselling and outcomes assessment - Validated questionnaires  The Augmentation Phalloplasty Patient Selection and Satisfaction Inventory (APPSSI) questionnaire is a 5-item   questionnaire proposed for the assessment and counselling about penile augmentation surgical treatment   [1465]. The Beliefs about Penis Size (BAPS) is a 10-item questionnaire created for audit and outcome research   to assess men’s beliefs about penile size [1464]. Both questionnaires have failed to correlate with penile size   and lack of objective validation has restricted their use.,

Cognitive behaviour therapy for BDD could be applied to cases of anxiety regarding penis size.,3
Penile traction therapy proved to be an effective treatment to achieve penile lengthening.,3
