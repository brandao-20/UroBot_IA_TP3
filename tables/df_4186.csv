A Cochrane review of published RCTs found imiquimod to be superior to placebo in achieving   complete clearance of warts.,1b

A systematic review and meta‐analysis confirmed the effectiveness of podophyllotoxin 0.5% solution   relative to placebo,1b

"Use self-administered podophyllotoxin 0.5% self-applied to lesions twice daily for three days,   followed by four rest days, for up to four or five weeks for the treatment of anogenital warts.",Strong

Summary of evidence,LE
The role of therapeutic HPV vaccination in males in terms of effectiveness and safety is limited by the   small number of relevant studies.,2
Therapeutic HPV vaccination in males is moderately effective against persistent anogenital HPV16   infection [(46.9% (28.6-60.8%)] and high-grade anal intraepithelial lesions [grade 2: 61.9% (21.4–82.8%);   grade 3: 46.8% (20-77.9%)].,1b
