"11.6.2.1	  Investigation of non-obstructive azoospermia  The diagnosis of NOA is based on the evidence of two consecutive semen analyses confirming azoospermia.   Causes of OA should be ruled out. Patients with NOA should undergo a comprehensive assessment to identify   genetically transmissible conditions, potential treatable causes of azoospermia, and potential health-relevant   co-morbidity (e.g., testicular cancer and hypogonadism [of any type]). A detailed medical history (e.g., history   of cryptorchidism, previous gonadotoxic treatments for cancer, etc.) and socio-demographic characteristics   [2200], along with a comprehensive physical examination should be performed in every patient to detect   conditions potentially leading to azoospermia, while ruling out co-morbidity frequently associated with   azoospermia. Non-obstructive azoospermia can be the first sign of pituitary or GCTs of the testis [2201-2203].   Patients with NOA have been shown to be at increased risk of being diagnosed with cancer [2204]. Moreover,   other systemic conditions such as MetS, T2DM, osteoporosis and CVDs have been more frequently observed   in patients with NOA compared to normozoospermic men [2205-2207]. Azoospermic men are at higher risk   of mortality [2208, 2209]. Therefore, investigation of infertile men provides an opportunity for long-term risk   stratification for other co-morbid conditions [2210].  Genetic tests should be performed in patients with NOA to detect genetic abnormalities. As   discussed (see Section 11.3), patients should undergo karyotype analysis [1805, 1806], along with a screening   of Y-chromosome micro-deletions [1855, 2211] and of the gene coding for CFTR in order to exclude   concomitant mutations, and to rule out CBAVD [1839, 1840]. Genetic counselling for eventual transmissible   and health-relevant genetic conditions should be provided to couples.",
Recommendations,Strength rating
Perform microsurgical vasovasostomy or epididymovasostomy for azoospermia caused by   epididymal or vasal obstruction in men with female partners of good ovarian reserve.,Strong
"Use sperm retrieval techniques, such as microsurgical epididymal sperm aspiration (MESA),   testicular sperm extraction (TESE) and percutaneous techniques (PESA and TESA) either as   an adjunct to reconstructive surgery, or if the condition is not amenable to surgical repair, or   when the ovarian reserve of the partner is limited or patient preference is not to undertake a   surgical reconstruction and the couple prefer to proceed to ICSI treatment directly.",Strong
