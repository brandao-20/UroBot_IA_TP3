"6.4.1.2	  Adjuvant chemotherapy   There are known poor prognostic characteristics for a subset of patients with resected high-risk disease (such   as involved pelvic LNs), indicating the likely presence of micrometastatic disease. Data exists on response   rates for those with metastatic disease and there is possible benefit for pre-operative chemotherapy for those   with unresectable locally advanced disease as described above. With extrapolation from other diseases, it   stands to reason that systemic therapy following resection (i.e., adjuvant therapy) may improve outcomes.",
Recommendations,Strength rating
"Offer neoadjuvant chemotherapy using a cisplatin- and taxane-based combination to   chemotherapy-fit patients with pelvic lymph node involvement or those with extensive   inguinal involvement (cN3), in preference to up front surgery.",Weak
Offer chemotherapy as an alternative approach to upfront surgery to selected patients with   bulky mobile inguinal nodes or bilateral disease (cN2) who are candidates for cisplatin and   taxane-based chemotherapy.,Weak
"Have a balanced discussion of risks and benefits of adjuvant chemotherapy with high-risk   patients with surgically resected disease, in particular with those with pathological pelvic LN   involvement (pN3). See also section on post-operative radiotherapy.",Weak
