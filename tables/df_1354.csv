"5.3.2.5	  Diode laser enucleation of the prostate  Mechanism of action: For prostate surgery, diode lasers with a wavelength of 940, 980, 1,318, and 1,470 nm   (depending on the semiconductor used) are marketed for vaporisation and enucleation. Only a few have been   evaluated in clinical trials [385].",
Summary of evidence,LE
"Laser enucleation of the prostate using the 1,318 nm or 1,470 laser showed comparable short-term   efficacy and safety to B-TURP. Peri-operative parameters like blood loss, catheterisation time and   hospital stay are in favour of diode enucleation.",1b
Laser enucleation of the prostate using the 980 nm laser showed comparable short-term efficacy and   safety to bipolar transurethral (plasmakinetic) enucleation.,1b
