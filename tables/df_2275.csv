Summary of evidence and guidelines for prostate biopsies,
Summary of evidence,LE
"Literature review including multiple biopsy schemes suggests that a minimum 12-core scheme is   optimal in the majority of initial and repeat biopsy patients, dependent on prostate size. These biopsy   schemes should be heavily weighted towards the lateral aspect and the apex of the prostate to   maximize peripheral zone sampling [299].",3
"Systematic review and meta-analysis comparing MRI-targeted transrectal biopsy to MRI-targeted   transperineal biopsy, analysing 8 studies, showed a higher sensitivity for detection of csPCa when the   transperineal approach was used (86% vs. 73%).",2
"Current literature, including systematic reviews and meta-analyses, does not show a clear superiority   of one image-guided technique (cognitive guidance, US/MR fusion software or direct in-bore   guidance) over the other.",2
Recommendations,Strength rating
"When performing systematic biopsy only, at least 12 cores are recommended.",Strong
Systematic transperineal biopsies are preferred over systematic transrectal biopsies for   detection of clinically significant PCa.,Strong
"Where magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has shown a suspicious lesion, MR-targeted   biopsy can be obtained through cognitive guidance, US/MR fusion software or direct   in-bore guidance.",Weak
