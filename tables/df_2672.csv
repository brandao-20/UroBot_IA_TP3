"3.1.10.4	  Steroids  Steroids have a large number of side effects [242-244, 295], especially with long-term use. Most practitioners   still consider steroids (either prednisolone or methylprednisolone) to be a fundamental adjunct to primary   immunosuppression, even though successful steroid withdrawal has been achieved in the vast majority of   patients in many prospective, randomised trials [242, 244, 245, 295, 300, 301]. The risk of steroid withdrawal   depends on the use of concomitant immunosuppressive medication, immunological risk, ethnicity, and   time after transplantation. Although the risk of rejection diminishes over time, potential benefits may be less   prominent after a prolonged steroid treatment period [242-245, 295]. Recent studies suggest similar efficacy   but less diabetes after early steroid withdrawal or steroid minimisation in low-risk patients treated with   tacrolimus, MPA and induction (either basiliximab or ATG) [302, 303].",
Recommendations,Strength rating
The m-TOR inhibitors may be used to prevent rejection in patients who are intolerant to   standard therapy.,Weak
Significantly reduce calcineurin inhibitor dosage in a combination regimen with   m-TOR inhibitors to prevent aggravated nephrotoxicity.,Strong
Do not convert patients with proteinuria and poor renal function to m-TOR inhibitors.,Strong
Monitor blood-levels of both sirolimus and everolimus to allow for appropriate dose   adjustment.,Strong
