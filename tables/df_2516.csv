7.2.5.5  Summary of evidence and recommendations for neoadjuvant and adjuvant therapy,
Summary of evidence,LE
Adjuvant pembrolizumab defined by the inclusion criteria of the trial* after nephrectomy   improves DFS.,1b
Adjuvant PD-L1 inhibition with atezolizumab did not improve DFS or OS.,1b
Adjuvant dual PD-1 and CTLA-4 inhibition with nivolumab and ipilimumab did not improve DFS.,1b
Peri-operative treatment with nivolumab did not improve RFS.,1b
The lack of biomarker data is hindering progress in this field. Adjuvant RCTs are ongoing to   evaluate the benefit of adjuvant immunotherapy after nephrectomy in high-risk patients.,4
Recommendation,Strength rating
Discuss the contradictory results of the available adjuvant ICI trials with patients to   facilitate shared decision making.,Strong
Inform patients about the potential risk of overtreatment and immune-related side   effects if adjuvant therapy is considered.,Strong
"Offer adjuvant pembrolizumab to ccRCC patients, preferably within 12–16 weeks   post-nephrectomy, with a recurrence risk as defined in the Keynote-564 trial:  •   Intermediate-high risk:   •   pT2, grade 4 or sarcomatoid, N0, M0  •   pT3, any grade, N0, M0  •   High risk:  •   pT4, any grade, N0, M0  •   any pT, any grade, N+, M0  •   M1 no evidence of disease (NED):  •   NED after resection of oligometastatic sites < 1 year from nephrectomy",Weak
