3.16.5	  Summary of evidence and recommendations for the management of obstructive pathology of   renal duplication: ureterocele and ectopic ureter,
Summary of evidence,LE
Posterior urethral valves are one of the few life-threatening congenital anomalies of the urinary tract   found during the neonatal period.,1b
"Antenatal therapy could be discussed based on ultrasound findings, fetal urine biochemistry amount   of amnion fluid and chromosomal status.",4
Despite optimal treatment nearly one-third of the patients end up in renal insufficiency.,2b
Bilateral hydroureteronephrosis and a distended bladder are suspicious signs on US; a VCUG   confirms the diagnosis.,2b
Serum creatinine nadir above 85 Î¼mol/L is correlated with a poor prognosis.,2a
"In the long-term up to 20% of patients develop end-stage renal failure due to primary dysplasia and/  or further deterioration because of bladder dysfunction. Renal transplantation in these patients is safe   and effective, if the bladder function is normalised.",2a
