"7.4.2.2	  Bleeding and pain  In the case of bleeding, the patient must be screened first for coagulation disorders or the patient’s use of   anticoagulant drugs must be reviewed. Transurethral (laser) coagulation may be difficult in a bladder full of   tumour or with a bleeding tumour. Intravesical rinsing of the bladder with 1% silver nitrate or 1–2% alum can   be effective [403]. This can usually be done without any anaesthesia. The instillation of formalin (2.5–4% for 30   minutes) is a more aggressive and painful procedure, requiring anaesthesia. Formalin instillation has a higher   risk of side-effects, e.g., bladder fibrosis, but is more likely to control the bleeding [403]. Vesicoureteral reflux   should be excluded to prevent renal complications.",
