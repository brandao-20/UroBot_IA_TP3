Table 12: Treatment regimens for newly diagnosed GUTB and MDR-TB [487],
Summary of evidence,LE
The risk of reactivation of latent TB is estimated to be 15% in an individual’s lifetime.,2a
Smear microscopy for acid-fast bacilli has a low sensitivity in urine ranging from 0-25%.,2a
Studies have reported high specificities of 92–100% but low sensitivities of 23.3–30% for urine culture   in renal TB specimens.,2a
Xpert MTB/RIF pooled sensitivity and specificity were 84.7% (70.8 to 93.1) and 97.3% (91.0 to 99.2)   for the diagnosis of GUTB.,1b
Standard six month anti-tuberculous drug regimens are effective in all forms of TB (pulmonary and   extrapulmonary).,1a
There is limited evidence with regard to the optimum surgical approach and timing of surgery in GUTB   patients.,3
Recommendations  Strength rating,
Diagnosis,
Take a full medical history including history of previous tuberculosis infection (pulmonary   and extrapulmonary) form all patients presenting with persistent non-specific genitourinary   symptoms and no identifiable cause.,Strong
"Perform smear microscopy on urine, semen, tissue specimens, discharged or prostatic   massage fluid using Ziehl–Neelsen (ZN) or auramine staining in patients with suspected   genitourinary tuberculosis (GUTB).",Weak
"Perform acid-fact bacilli culture on three midstream first-void urine samples, on three   consecutive days for M. tuberculosis isolation in patients with suspected GUTB.",Strong
Use a recommended PCR test system in addition to microbiological reference standard   (MRS) in urine specimens as a diagnostic test in patients with signs and symptoms of   GUTB.,Weak
Use imaging modalities in combination with culture and/or PCR to aid in the diagnosis of   GUTB and to assess the location and extent of damage to the genitourinary system.,Weak
Treatment,
Use medical treatment as first-line treatment for GUTB.,Strong
"Use a daily six-month regimen for treatment of newly diagnosed GUTB this should include   an intensive phase of two months with isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide and ethambutol.   Followed by a continuation phase of four-months with isoniazid and rifampicin.",Strong
"Treat multi-drug resistant TB with an individualised treatment regime including at least five   effective tuberculosis medicines during the intensive phase, including pyrazinamide and   four core second-line tuberculosis medicines.",Strong
