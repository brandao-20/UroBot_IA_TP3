"7.4.3.1.3	 Influence of further factors  Two other meta-analyses have suggested a possible bias in favour of BCG arising from the inclusion of patients   previously treated with intravesical chemotherapy [308]. In the individual patient data meta-analysis, however,   BCG maintenance was more effective than MMC in reduction of recurrence rate, both in patients previously   treated and not previously treated with chemotherapy [282] (LE: 1a). It was demonstrated that BCG was less   effective in patients > 70 years of age, but still more effective than epirubicin in a cohort of elderly patients [309]   (LE: 1a). According to a cohort analysis, the risk of tumour recurrence after BCG was shown to be higher in   patients with a previous history of UTUC [310].",
Summary of evidence,LE
"In patients with low-risk NMIBC and in those with a small Ta LG/G1 recurrence detected more than   one year after previous TURB, a SI significantly reduces the recurrence rate compared to TURB alone.",1a
Single instillation might have an impact on recurrence even when further adjuvant chemotherapy   instillations are given.,3
Repeat chemotherapy instillations (with or without previous SI) improve RFS in intermediate-risk   patients.,2a
