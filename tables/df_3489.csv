Recommendations,Strength rating
New 2023 recommendation: Offer adjuvant platinum-based chemotherapy after RNU   to patients with pT2â€“T4 and/or pN+ disease.,Strong
"New 2023 recommendation: Discuss adjuvant nivolumab with patients unfit   for, or who declined, platinum-based adjuvant chemotherapy for > pT3 and/or   pN+ disease after RNU alone or > ypT2 and/or ypN+ disease after neoadjuvant   chemotherapy, followed by RNU.",Weak
"2022 recommendation: Offer kidney-sparing management to patients with solitary   kidney and/or impaired renal function, providing that it will not compromise survival.   This decision will have to be made on a case-by-case basis in consultation with the   patient.",Strong
"Revised 2023 recommendation: Offer kidney-sparing management to high-risk   patients with imperative indication on a case-by-case basis, in consultation with the   patient.",Strong
Erdafitinib was associated with radiological response in platinum-refractory patients with   locally-advanced or metastatic UC and FGFR DNA genomic alterations (FGFR2/3 mutations   or FGFR3 fusions).,2a
Enfortumab vedotin was associated with OS benefit in patients who had previously received   platinum-containing chemotherapy and experienced disease progression during or after   treatment with a PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitor.,1b
Palliative nephroureterectomy can improve quality of life by controlling symptomatic disease.,3
RNU can confer a survival benefit in highly selected patients.,4
