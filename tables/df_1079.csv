"4.3	  Mixed urinary incontinence   The term MUI is broad because it may refer to equal stress and urgency symptoms, stress-predominant   symptoms, urgency-predominant symptoms, urodynamic stress urinary incontinence (USUI or USI) with DO or   USUI with clinical urgency symptoms, but no DO [434]. The challenge of this broad definition is that it leads to   inconsistencies when evaluating treatment options and outcomes.",
