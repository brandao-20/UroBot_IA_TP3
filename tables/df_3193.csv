"9.3.2.2	  Surgical treatment of congenital intrinsic penile shortness  Current literature reports a wide spectrum of possible surgical interventions aimed to address penile   shortness. Nonetheless, the proposed spectrum of surgical interventions starts from less invasive procedures   - such as suspensory ligament release (SLR) - to more complex genital reconstruction - such as total phallic   reconstruction (TPR) [1493, 1494]. These issues make the surgical treatment of congenital intrinsic penile   shortness a surgical challenge in urology.",
