"6.3.5.2.1.2	Endoluminal treatment after failed urethroplasty for post-traumatic posterior stenosis  In case of a non-obliterative and short (< 1 cm) recurrence after failed urethroplasty, endoluminal treatment can   be performed [437]. Although a 1st and 2nd DVIU can be successful with a stricture-free rate of 22.9-77.3% and   0-60% respectively, three or more incisions are never successful (see supplementary Table S6.16) [437-440].   Therefore, repetitive endoluminal treatments (dilations and/or endoscopic incisions) can only be considered as   a palliative option [441].",
Recommendations,Strength rating
Do not perform endoscopic treatment for an obliterative stenosis.,Strong
"Perform one attempt at endoluminal treatment for a short, non-obliterative stenosis.",Weak
Do not perform more than two direct vision internal urethrotomies and/or dilatations for a   short and non-obliterative recurrence after excision and primary anastomosis for a traumatic   posterior stenosis if long-term urethral patency is the desired intent.,Weak
