Vasculogenic
"Recreational habits (i.e., cigarette smoking)"
Lack of regular physical exercise
Obesity
"Cardiovascular diseases (e.g., hypertension, coronary artery disease, peripheral vasculopathy)"
Type 1 and 2 diabetes mellitus; hyperlipidaemia; metabolic syndrome; hyperhomocysteinemia
"Major pelvic surgery (e.g., radical prostatectomy) or radiotherapy (pelvis or retroperitoneum)"
Neurogenic
Central causes
"Degenerative disorders (e.g., multiple sclerosis, Parkinson’s disease, multiple atrophy, etc.)"
Spinal cord trauma or diseases
Stroke
Central nervous system tumours
Peripheral causes
Type 1 and 2 diabetes mellitus
"Chronic renal failure, chronic liver failure"
Polyneuropathy
Surgery (major surgery of pelvis/retroperitoneum) or radiotherapy (pelvis or retroperitoneum)
"Surgery of the urethra (urethral stricture, open urethroplasty, etc.)"
Anatomical or structural
"Hypospadias, epispadias; micropenis"
Phimosis
Peyronie’s disease
Penile cancer (other tumours of the external genitalia)
Hormonal
Diabetes mellitus; Metabolic Syndrome;
Hypogonadism (any type)
Hyperthyroidism
"Hyper- and hypocortisolism (Cushing’s disease, etc.)"
Panhypopituitarism and multiple endocrine disorders
Mixed pathophysiological pathways
"Chronic systemic diseases (e.g., diabetes mellitus, hypertension, metabolic syndrome, chronic kidney   disease, chronic liver disorders, hyperhomocysteinemia, hyperuricemia, chronic obstructive pulmonary   disease, rheumatic disease)"
"Psoriasis, gouty arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, chronic periodontitis, open-  angle glaucoma, inflammatory bowel disease, chronic fatigue syndrome, allergic rhinitis, obstructive sleep   apnoea, depression"
Iatrogenic causes (e.g. TRUS-guided prostate biopsy)
Drug-induced
"Antihypertensives (i.e., thiazidediuretics, beta-blockers)*"
"Antidepressants (e.g., selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, tricyclics)"
Antipsychotics
Antiandrogens (GnRH analogues and antagonists; 5-ARIs)
"Recreational drugs (e.g., heroin, cocaine, marijuana, methadone, synthetic drugs, anabolic steroids, excessive   alcohol intake)"
Psychogenic
"Generalised type (e.g., lack of arousability and disorders of sexual intimacy)"
"Situational type (e.g., partner-related, performance-related issues or due to distress)"
Trauma
Penile fracture
Pelvic fractures
