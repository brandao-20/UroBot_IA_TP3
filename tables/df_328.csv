Table 3:   Comparison between visceral and somatic pain,,
,Visceral pain,Somatic pain
Effective painful stimuli,"Stretching and distension,   producing poorly localised pain.","Mechanical, thermal, chemical and   electrical stimuli, producing well   localised pain."
Summation,Widespread stimulation produces   significantly magnified pain.,Widespread stimulation produces a   modest increase in pain.
Autonomic involvement,"Autonomic features (e.g., nausea   and sweating) frequently present.",Autonomic features less frequent.
Referred pain,Pain perceived at a site distant to   the cause of the pain is common.,Pain is relatively well localised and   well recognised.
Referred hyperalgesia,"Referred cutaneous and muscle   hyperalgesia is common, as is   involvement of other visceral   organs.",Hyperalgesia tends to be localised.
Innervation,"Low density, unmyelinated C fibres   and thinly myelinated Aâˆ‚ fibres.",Dense innervation with a wide   range of nerve fibres.
Primary afferent physiology,"Intensity coding. As stimulation   increases, afferent firing increases   with an increase in sensation and   ultimately pain.",Two fibre coding. Separate fibres   for pain and normal sensation.
Silent afferents,50-90% of visceral afferents   are silent until the time they are   switched on.,"These fibres are very important in   the central sensitisation process.   Silent afferents present, but form a   lower percentage."
Central mechanisms,"Play an important part in the   hyperalgesia, viscero-visceral,   viscero-muscular and musculo-  visceral hyperalgesia.",Sensations not normally perceived   become perceived and non-  noxious sensations become   painful. Responsible for the   allodynia and hyperalgesia of   chronic somatic pain.
Abnormalities of function,Central mechanisms associated   with visceral pain may be   responsible for organ dysfunction.,"Somatic pain associated with   somatic dysfunction, e.g., muscle   spasm."
Central pathways and   representation,"As well as classical pathways,   there is evidence for a separate   dorsal horn pathway and central   representation.",Classical pain pathways.
