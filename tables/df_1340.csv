"5.2	  Pharmacological treatment  5.2.1	  Alpha 1-Adrenoceptor antagonists (α1-blockers)  Mechanism of action: Alpha 1-blockers aim to inhibit the effect of endogenously released noradrenaline on   smooth muscle cells in the prostate and thereby reduce prostate tone and BOO [143]. However, α1-blockers have   little effect on urodynamically determined bladder outlet resistance [144], and treatment-associated improvement   of LUTS correlates poorly with obstruction [145]. Thus, other mechanisms of action may also be relevant.  Alpha 1-adrenoceptors located outside the prostate (e.g. urinary bladder and/or spinal cord)   and α1-adrenoceptor subtypes (α1B- or α1D-adrenoceptors) may play a role as mediators of effects. Alpha   1-adrenoceptors in blood vessels, other non-prostatic smooth muscle cells, and the central nervous system   may mediate adverse events.  Currently available α1-blockers are: alfuzosin hydrochloride (alfuzosin); doxazosin mesylate   (doxazosin); silodosin; tamsulosin hydrochloride (tamsulosin); terazosin hydrochloride (terazosin); and   naftopidil. Alpha 1-blockers exist in different formulations. Although different formulations result in different   pharmacokinetic and tolerability profiles, the overall difference in clinical efficacy between the difference   formulations seems negligible.",
Summary of evidence,LE
Alpha 1-blockers are effective in reducing urinary symptoms (IPSS) and increasing the peak urinary   flow rate (Qmax) compared with placebo.,1a
"Alfuzosin, terazosin and doxazosin showed a statistically significant increased risk of developing   vascular-related events compared with placebo.",1a
"Alfuzosin, doxazosin, tamsulosin or terazosin exposure has been associated with an increased risk of   IFIS.",1a
"Ejaculatory dysfunction is significantly more common with α1-blockers than with placebo, particularly   with more selective α1-blockers such as tamsulosin and silodosin.",1a
