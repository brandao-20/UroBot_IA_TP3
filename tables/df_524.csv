Summary of evidence and guidelines for radical cystectomy and urinary diversion,
Summary of evidence,LE
Higher RC hospital volume is associated with lower post-operative mortality rates and higher quality of   care.,3
Radical cystectomy includes removal of regional LNs.,3
There are data to support that extended vs. standard LND improves survival after RC.,3
No conclusive evidence exists as to the optimal extent of LND.,2a
"Ensuring that patients are well informed about the various urinary diversion options prior to making a   decision may help prevent or reduce decision regret, independent of the method of diversion selected.",3
The type of urinary diversion does not affect oncological outcome.,3
The use of extended VTE prophylaxis significantly decreases the incidence of VTE after RC.,3
"In patients aged > 80 years with MIBC, cystectomy is an option.",3
"Surgical complications of cystectomy and urinary diversion should be reported using a uniform   grading system. Currently, the best-adapted grading system for cystectomy is the Clavien Dindo   grading system.",2b
Recommendations,Strength rating
"Do not delay radical cystectomy (RC) for > 3 months as it increases the risk of progression   and cancer-specific mortality, unless the patient receives neoadjuvant chemotherapy.",Strong
"Perform at least 10, and preferably > 20, RCs per hospital/per year.",Strong
"Before RC, fully inform the patient about the benefits and potential risks of all possible   alternatives. The final decision should be based on a balanced discussion between the   patient and the surgeon.",Strong
Do not offer an orthotopic bladder substitute diversion to patients who have an invasive   tumour in the urethra or at the level of urethral dissection.,Strong
Do not offer pre-operative bowel preparation.,Strong
Employ ‘Fast track’ measurements to reduce the time to bowel recovery.,Strong
"Offer pharmacological VTE prophylaxis, such as low-molecular-weight heparin to RC   patients, starting the first day post-surgery, for a period of at least 4 weeks.",Strong
"Offer RC to patients with T2–T4a, N0M0 disease or very high-risk non-muscle-invasive   bladder cancer.",Strong
Perform a lymph node dissection as an integral part of RC.,Strong
