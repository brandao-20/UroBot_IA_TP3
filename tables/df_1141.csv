Table 6: Adapted WHO Classification of fistulae [669]*,
Summary of evidence,LE
The risk of injury to the urinary tract and subsequent fistula formation is higher in women with   malignant disease undergoing radical surgery than in women with benign disease undergoing simple   surgical procedures.,2
The rate of fistula formation following external beam radiotherapy for gynaecological cancer appears   to be of the same order as that following surgical treatment.,4
Simple fistula with good prognosis,Complex fistula with uncertain prognosis
•   Single fistula < 4 cm  •   Vesico-vaginal fistula  •   Closing mechanism not involved  •   No circumferential defect  •   Minimal tissue loss  •   Ureters not involved  •   First attempt to repair,"•   Fistula > 4 cm  •   Multiple fistula  •   Recto-vaginal mixed fistula, cervical fistula  •   Closing mechanism involved  •   Scarring  •   Circumferential defect  •   Extensive tissue loss  •   Intravaginal ureters  •   Failed previous repair  •   Radiation fistula"
Summary of evidence,LE
"As for any LUTS, history taking and focused physical examination with direct visual inspection are   essential parts of urinary fistula diagnostic evaluation.",3
Cystoscopy and retrograde bladder filling with a coloured fluid with placement of a tampon into the   vagina to identify staining facilitate diagnosis of VVF.,3
Contrast-enhanced CT with late excretory phase reliably diagnoses urinary fistulae and provides   information about ureteric integrity.,3
"Magnetic resonance imaging, in particular with T2 weighting, also provides diagnostic information   regarding fistulae.",3
Recommendations,Strength rating
Take a complete medical history and perform a focused physical examination including   direct visual inspection for evaluation of women with suspicion of urinary fistula.,Strong
Use cystoscopy and retrograde bladder filling with a coloured fluid to confirm the diagnosis   of urinary fistula.,Weak
Contrast-enhanced CT with late excretory phase and magnetic resonance imaging can be   used in cases where the diagnosis of urinary fistula is challenging or to provide additional   diagnostic information.,Weak
