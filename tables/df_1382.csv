Table 4: Epidemiology and pathophysiology overview of male UI [556-560].,,,,
Type,Definition,Causes and   associated factors,Pathophysiology,Clinical presentation
Stress UI:   prevalence    < 10%,Urine loss during   movement or   efforts or in general   during increased   abdominal   pressure.,•   Benign Prostatic   Obstruction   surgery   •   Neurogenic   condition  •   Pelvic surgery  •   Radical   prostatectomy   •   Urethral surgery,Sphincter deficiency,"Symptoms: UI during   physical activity,   exercises, e.g. during   coughing, sneezing, no   leakage during sleep,   no nocturnal enuresis  Voiding diary/Pad   test: with activity  Cough stress test:   leakage can coincide   with coughing"
Urgency UI:   prevalence   40-80%,Urine loss   concomitant   or immediately   following an   urgency episode.,"•   Ageing process  •   Anorectal   dysfunction/GI   disorders  •   Behavioural   factors (fluid   intake and caffeine   consumption)  •   Chronic BPO   •   Idiopathic   •   Intrinsic bladder   diseases (cystitis,   fibrosis, interstitial   cystitis)  •   Metabolic   syndrome  •   Neurogenic   conditions  •   UTIs","•   Detrusor   overactivity   (neurogenic or not)  •   Urothelial   stimulation   •   Increased afferent   signalling  •   Others (pelvic   organ cross talk,   bladder wall   ischemia etc.)","Symptoms: urgency,   usually associated with,   increased frequency   and nocturia  Voiding diary: urgency,   frequency and nocturia"
Mixed UI:   prevalence   10-30%,Any combination   of SUI and UUI.,Causes of both SIU   and UUI,Combination of SUI   and UUI,Symptoms: UI equally   as often with physical   activity as with a sense   of urgency  Voiding diary: varies  Cough stress test:   may show leakage with   coughing
Summary of evidence,LE,,,
Validated specific symptom score questionnaires and voiding diaries assist in the screening for and   categorisation of UI.,3,,,
"Pad test can be used to quantify the presence and severity of UI, as well as a patient’s response to   treatment.",3,,,
There is limited evidence that urodynamics and PVR affect treatment choice in men with   uncomplicated UI.,3,,,
Recommendation,Strength rating,,,
"Take a complete medical history including symptoms and co-morbidities, medications, and   a focused physical examination in the evaluation of men with urinary incontinence (UI).",Strong,,,
"Use a validated symptom score questionnaire, bladder diary and pad-test to assess UI.",Strong,,,
Measure post-void residual in the assessment of UI.,Strong,,,
Perform urodynamics for UI when considering invasive treatment.,Weak,,,
