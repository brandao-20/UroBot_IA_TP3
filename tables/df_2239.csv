"6.1	  Treatment modalities   6.1.1	  Deferred treatment (active surveillance/watchful waiting)  As PCa is such a common disease, and with the increased rate of early detection of small tumours after the   introduction of PSA, there is a distinct risk of over-diagnosis and subsequent over-treatment of the disease [474].   As all available curative treatment options for PCa carry a risk of significant side effects there is a need for   conservative treatment options for patients with low risk of dying from their PCa. Data from studies conducted   on patients who did not undergo local treatment with up to 25 years of follow-up, with endpoints of OS and CSS,   are available. Several series have shown a consistent CSS rate of 82–87% at 10 years [475-478], and 80–95% for   T1/T2 and ISUP grade < 2 PCas [479]. In three studies with data beyond 15 years, the CSS was 80%, 79% and   58% respectively [475, 477, 478], and two reported 20-year CSS rates of 57% and 32% [475, 477]. The observed   heterogeneity in outcomes is due to different inclusion criteria, with some older studies from the pre-PSA era   showing worse outcomes [477]. In addition, many patients classified as ISUP grade 1 would now be classified as   ISUP grade 2–3 based on the 2005 Gleason classification, suggesting that the above-mentioned results should   be considered as minimal. Patients with well-, moderately- and poorly-differentiated tumours had 10-year CSS   rates of 91%, 90% and 74%, respectively, correlating with data from a pooled analysis [479]. Observation is   most effective in men aged 65–75 years with low-risk PCa [480]. In screen-detected localised PCa there is also a   lead-time bias, resulting in a higher rate of early detected PCa, but also an even higher risk of detecting clinically   insignificant PCa that never would have caused any problems [474]. Cancer-specific survival from untreated   screen-detected PCa in patients with ISUP grade 1–2 is therefore likely to be even higher than for PCa detected   of other reasons. Consequently, a high proportion of men with PSA-detected PCa are suitable for conservative   treatment.",
