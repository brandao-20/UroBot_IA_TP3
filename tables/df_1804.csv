"7.2	  Treatment of localised primary urethral carcinoma in females  7.2.1	  Urethrectomy and urethra-sparing surgery  In women with localised urethral carcinoma, to provide the highest chance of local cure, primary radical   urethrectomy should include removal of all the peri-urethral tissue from the bulbocavernosus muscle bilaterally   and distally, with a cylinder of all adjacent soft tissue up to the pubic symphysis and bladder neck. Bladder   neck closure and appendicovesicostomy for primary distal urethral lesions has been shown to provide   satisfactory functional results [39].  Previous series have reported outcomes in women with mainly distal urethral tumours undergoing   primary treatment with urethra-sparing surgery, with or without additional radiotherapy (RT) compared to   primary urethrectomy with the aim of maintaining integrity and function of the lower urinary tract [74, 75]. In   longer-term series with a median follow-up of 153–175 months, local recurrence rates in women undergoing   partial urethrectomy with intra-operative frozen section analysis were 22–60%, and distal sleeve resection of   > 2 cm resulted in secondary urinary incontinence in 42% of patients who subsequently required additional   reconstructive surgery [74, 75].  Ablative surgical techniques, i.e., transurethral resection (TUR) or laser, used for small distal   urethral tumours, have also resulted in considerable local failure rates of 16%, with a CSS rate of 50%. This   emphasises the critical role of local tumour control in women with distal urethral carcinoma to prevent local and   systemic progression [74].",
Recommendations,Strength rating
"Offer distal urethrectomy as an alternative to penile amputation in localised distal urethral   tumours, if negative surgical margins can be achieved intra-operatively.",Weak
Ensure complete circumferential assessment of the proximal urethral margin if penile   preserving surgery is intended.,Strong
