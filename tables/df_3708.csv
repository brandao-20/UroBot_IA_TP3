"6.3.5.1.3.3.2	Prostatic strictures secondary to radiation/high energy sources  Radiotherapy and high-energy modalities (cryoablation, HIFU) might provoke prostatic necrosis, sloughing   and obstruction [100]. Cases refractory to TUR and with good bladder capacity might be salvaged by   prostatectomy taking into account the morbidity associated with salvage RP (rectal injury, VUAS, incontinence)   [100, 423]. Mundy et al., treated nine patients with patency in six, (67%) and one (11%) needing an AUS for   severe incontinence [410].",
Recommendations,Strength rating
Perform bladder neck reconstruction with Y-V or T-plasty for treatment refractory bladder   neck stenosis (BNS).,Weak
Warn patients about de novo urinary incontinence after reconstruction for BNS or   bulbomembranous urethral strictures with previous benign prostatic obstruction surgery as   aetiology.,Strong
