"5.3.5.2	  Intra-prostatic injections  Mechanism of action: Various substances have been injected directly into the prostate in order to improve   LUTS including Botulinum toxin-A (BoNT-A), fexapotide triflutate (NX-1207) and PRX302. The primary   mechanism of action of BoNT-A is through the inhibition of neurotransmitter release from cholinergic neurons   [525]. The mechanisms of action for the injectables NX-1207 and PRX302 are not completely understood, but   experimental data suggest apoptosis-induced atrophy of the prostate with both drugs [525].",
