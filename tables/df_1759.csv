"3.20.4.2	  Disease management  Since many of these patients are unstable, the urologistâ€™s initial responsibility is to provide a method of draining   and monitoring urine output.  A transurethral catheter should only be inserted if there is a history of voiding after the traumatic   event, and if a rectal and pelvic examination, as described above, has not suggested a urethral rupture. If the   catheter does not pass easily, an immediate retrograde urethrogram should be performed. A suprapubic tube   may be placed in the emergency department percutaneously, or even in the operating room, if the patient has   to undergo immediate exploration because of other life-threatening injuries.  There are often no associated injuries with a bulbous urethral or straddle injury and management   is therefore usually straightforward. In these cases, a transurethral catheter is the best option for preventing   urethral bleeding and/or painful voiding [1468].  The initial management of posterior urethral injuries remains controversial, mainly regarding the   long-term results with primary realignment compared to simple suprapubic drainage with later reconstruction.",
Recommendations,Strength rating
Use retrograde cystography to diagnose suspected bladder injuries.,Strong
Ensure that the bladder has been filled to its full capacity and an additional film is taken   after drainage.,Strong
Manage extra-peritoneal bladder ruptures conservatively with a transurethral catheter left in   place for seven to ten days.,Strong
Do not delay treatment of intra-peritoneal bladder ruptures by surgical exploration and   repair as well as post-operative drainage for seven to ten days.,Strong
