7.2.5.5	  Summary of evidence and recommendations for neoadjuvant and adjuvant therapy,
Summary of evidence,LE
"Adjuvant sorafenib, pazopanib, everolimus, girentuximab, or axitinib does not improve DFS or OS after   nephrectomy.",1b
"In one single RCT, in selected high-risk patients, adjuvant sunitinib improved DFS but not OS.",1b
Adjuvant pembrolizumab defined by the inclusion criteria of the trial* after nephrectomy improves DFS.,1b
Adjuvant PD-L1 inhibition with atezolizumab did not improve DFS or OS.,1b
Adjuvant dual PD-1 and CTLA-4 inhibition with nivolumab and ipilimumab did not improve DFS.,1b
Peri-operative treatment with nivolumab did not improve RFS.,1b
The lack of biomarker data is hindering progress in this field. Adjuvant RCTs are ongoing to evaluate   the benefit of adjuvant immunotherapy after nephrectomy in high-risk patients.,4
