3.4.10.5  Summary of evidence and recommendations for the management of renal stones,
Summary of evidence,LE
"It is still debatable whether renal stones should be treated, or whether annual follow-up is sufficient for   asymptomatic calyceal stones that have remained stable for six months.",4
"Although the question of whether asymptomatic calyceal stones should be treated is still unanswered,   stone growth, de novo obstruction, associated infection, and acute and/or chronic pain are indications   for treatment.",3
Percutaneous nephrolithotomy is indicated in renal stones > 2 cm as primary option.,1a
Recommendations,Strength rating
Follow-up periodically in cases where renal stones are not treated (initially after six months   then yearly evaluating symptoms and stone status either by ultrasound or kidney-ureter   bladder radiography. Use computed tomography (CT) when intervention is required.,Strong
"Offer active treatment for renal stones in case of stone growth, de novo obstruction,   associated infection, and acute and/or chronic pain.",Weak
"Evaluate stone composition before deciding on the method of removal, based on patient   history, former stone analysis of the patient or Hounsfield unit (HU) on unenhanced CT.   Stones with density > 1,000 HU (and with high homogeneity) on non-contrast-enhanced CT   are less likely to be disintegrated by shock wave lithotripsy.",Strong
Perform percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PNL) as first-line treatment of larger stones > 2 cm.,Strong
"Treat larger stones (> 2 cm) with flexible ureteroscopy or shock wave lithotripsy (SWL), in   cases where PNL is not an option. However, in such instances there is a higher risk that a   follow-up procedure and placement of a ureteral stent may be needed.",Strong
"Perform PNL or retrograde intrarenal surgery for the lower pole, even for stones > 1 cm, as   the efficacy of SWL is limited (depending on favourable and unfavourable factors for SWL).",Strong
