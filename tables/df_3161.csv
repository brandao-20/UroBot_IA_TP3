3.5.4	  Summary of evidence and recommendations for the diagnostic evaluation of LOH,
Recommendations,Strength rating
"Check for concomitant diseases, drugs and substances that can interfere with testosterone   production/action.",Strong
"Measure total testosterone in the morning (07.00 and 11.00 hours) and in the fasting state,   with a reliable laboratory assay.",Strong
Repeat total testosterone on at least two separate occasions when < 12 nmol/L and before   starting testosterone therapy.,Strong
Use 12 nmol/L total testosterone (3.5 ng/mL) as a reliable threshold to diagnose late onset   hypogonadism (LOH).,Strong
Consider sex hormone-binding globulin and free-testosterone calculation when indicated.,Strong
Calculated free-testosterone of < 225 pmol/L has been suggested as a possible cut-off to   diagnose LOH.,Weak
Analyse luteinising hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone serum levels to differentiate   between primary and secondary hypogonadism.,Strong
Consider prolactin (PRL) measurement if low sexual desire (or other suggestive signs/  symptoms) and low or low-normal testosterone is present.,Strong
"Perform pituitary magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in secondary hypogonadism, with   elevated PRL or symptoms specific of a pituitary mass and/or presence of other anterior   pituitary hormone deficiency.",Strong
Perform pituitary MRI in secondary severe hypogonadism (total testosterone < 6 nmol/L).,Weak
