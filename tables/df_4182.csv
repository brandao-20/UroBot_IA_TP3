3.11.4.8  Summary of evidence and recommendations for the diagnosis of bacterial prostatitis,
Summary of evidence,LE
Urine dipstick testing for nitrite and leukocytes has a positive predictive value of 95% and a negative   predictive value of 70% in patients with ABP.,3
The four-glass Meares and Stamey test is the optimum test for diagnosis of CBP. The two-glass test   has been shown to offer similar diagnostic sensitivity in a comparison study.,2b
First-void urine is the preferred specimen for the diagnosis of urogenital C. trachomatis infection in   men by NAATs.,2b
Transrectal ultrasound is unreliable and cannot be used as a diagnostic tool in prostatitis.,3
"Semen culture sensitivity is reported to be approximately 50%; therefore, it is not routinely part of the   diagnostic assessment of CBP.",3
"Prostate specific antigen levels may be elevated during active prostatitis; therefore, PSA testing   should be avoided as it offers no practical diagnostic information for prostatitis.",3
Recommendations,Strength rating
Do not perform prostatic massage in acute bacterial prostatitis (ABP).,Strong
Take a mid-stream urine dipstick to check nitrite and leukocytes in patients with clinical   suspicion of ABP.,Weak
Take a mid-stream urine culture in patients with ABP symptoms to guide diagnosis and   tailor antibiotic treatment.,Weak
Take a blood culture and a total blood count in patients presenting with ABP.,Weak
Perform accurate microbiological evaluation for atypical pathogens such as Chlamydia   trachomatis or Mycoplasmata in patients with chronic bacterial prostatitis (CBP).,Weak
Perform the Meares and Stamey 2- or 4-glass test in patients with CBP.,Strong
Perform transrectal ultrasound in selected cases to rule out the presence of prostatic   abscess.,Weak
Do not routinely perform microbiological analysis of the ejaculate alone to diagnose CBP.,Weak
