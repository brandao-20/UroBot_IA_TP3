"3.4.2	  Diagnostic evaluation  The classic description of a communicating hydrocele is that of a hydrocele that fluctuates in size,   and is usually related to ambulation. It may be diagnosed by history-taking and physical investigation.   Transillumination of the scrotum provides the diagnosis in the majority of cases, keeping in mind that fluid   filled intestine and some pre-pubertal tumours may transilluminate as well [189, 190]. If the diagnosis is that   of a hydrocele, there will be no history of reducibility and no associated symptoms; the swelling is translucent,   smooth and usually not tender. If there are any doubts about the character of an intrascrotal mass, scrotal US   should be performed and has nearly 100% sensitivity in detecting intrascrotal lesions. Doppler US studies   help to distinguish hydroceles from varicocele and testicular torsion, although these conditions may also be   accompanied by a hydrocele.",,
