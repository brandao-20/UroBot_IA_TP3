"5.3.2.5	  Diode laser enucleation of the prostate  Mechanism of action: For prostate surgery, diode lasers with a wavelength of 940, 980, 1,318, and 1,470 nm   (depending on the semiconductor used) are marketed for vaporisation and enucleation. Only a few have been   evaluated in clinical trials [385].",
Summary of evidence,LE
Laser vaporisation of the prostate using the 120-W 980 nm diode laser demonstrated high intra-  operative safety with regard to haemostatic properties when compared to TURP. Peri-operative   parameters like catheterisation time and hospital stay were in favour of diode lasers. Evidence is   limited by the number and quality of the available studies.,1b
"In a number of studies, post-operative complications such as severe storage symptoms and persisting   incontinence, occurred with laser vaporisation of the prostate using the 120-W 980 nm diode laser.",3
Laser vaporisation using the 120-W 980 nm diode laser seems to be safe with regard to haemostasis   in patients receiving anticoagulant therapy.,3
