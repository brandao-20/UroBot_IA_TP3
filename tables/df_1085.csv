Summary of evidence,LE
Abdominal straining with relaxation of the PFM may improve bladder emptying but increases the risk   of POP.,3
"Pelvic floor muscle relaxation training may increase voiding episodes, decrease post-void residual   volume and voiding time.",3
Clean intermittent self-catheterisation has proven efficacy in terms of effecting bladder emptying in   patients who are unable to do so.,3
Indwelling transurethral catheterisation and suprapubic cystostomy are associated with a range of   complications as well as an increased risk of UTI.,3
"Intravesical electrical stimulation may be useful in some patients after prolonged bladder over-  distension, but long-term efficacy remains unproven.",3
Parasympathomimetics do not improve clinical or urodynamic parameters of UAB and frequent and/or   serious adverse effects may arise.,1b
Alpha-adrenergic blockers in women with UAB may be effective in improving voided volume and   reducing PVR volume.,2b
Very low certainty evidence indicates that intravesical prostaglandins may promote successful voiding   in patients with urinary retention after surgery.,1a
Sacral nerve stimulation improves voided volume and decreases PVR volume in women with DU.,1b
There is limited evidence for the effectiveness of onabotulinumtoxinA external urethral sphincter   injections to improve voiding in women with UAB.,3
"Transurethral bladder neck incision may improve voiding in women with DU, but complications (SUI,   vesico-vaginal fistulae) may occur.",3
There is very limited evidence for the effectiveness of detrusor myoplasty for bladder acontractility.,3
