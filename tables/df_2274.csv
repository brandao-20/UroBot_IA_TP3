Recommendations in biopsy-naïve patients,Strength rating,,,,
Perform MRI before prostate biopsy.,Strong,,,,
"When MRI is positive (i.e., PI-RADS > 3), combine targeted and systematic biopsy.",Strong,,,,
"When MRI is negative (i.e., PI-RADS < 2), and clinical suspicion of PCa is low (e.g., PSA   density < 0.15 ng/mL), omit biopsy based on shared decision-making with the patient.",Weak,,,,
Recommendations in patients with prior negative biopsy,Strength rating,,,,
Perform MRI before prostate biopsy.,Strong,,,,
"When MRI is positive (i.e., PI-RADS > 3), perform targeted biopsy only.",Weak,,,,
"When MRI is negative (i.e., PI-RADS < 2), and clinical suspicion of PCa is high, perform   systematic biopsy based on shared decision-making with the patient.",Strong,,,,
