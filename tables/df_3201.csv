10.1.5	  Recommendations for the treatment of ischaemic priapism,
Recommendations,Strength rating
Start management of ischaemic priapism as early as possible (within four to six hours) and   follow a stepwise approach.,Strong
"First, decompress the corpus cavernosum by penile aspiration and washout until fresh red   blood is obtained.",Strong
"In priapism secondary to intracavernous injections of vasoactive agents, replace blood   aspiration with intracavernous injection of a sympathomimetic drug as the first step.",Strong
"In priapism that persists despite aspiration, proceed to the next step, which is   intracavernous injection of a sympathomimetic drug.",Strong
"In cases that persist despite aspiration and intracavernous injection of a sympathomimetic   drug, repeat these steps before considering surgical intervention.",Strong
"Treat ischaemic priapism associated with sickle cell disease in the same fashion as   idiopathic ischaemic priapism. Provide other supportive measures (intravenous hydration,   oxygen administration with alkalisation with bicarbonate, blood exchange transfusions), but   do not delay initial treatment to the penis.",Strong
Proceed to surgical treatment only when blood aspiration and intracavernous injection of   sympathomimetic drugs have failed.,Strong
Perform distal shunt surgical procedures first and combine them with tunnelling if necessary.,Weak
Proximal procedures may be used in cases of distal shunt failure (< 48 hours) or in patients   who do not wish to proceed with immediate penile implant insertion.,Weak
Peri- and post-operative anticoagulation may decrease priapism recurrence.,Weak
A penile prosthesis may be preferred over proximal shunting particularly in delayed > 48   hours) or refractory priapism.,Weak
Implantation of a prosthesis may be considered in delayed presentation (> 48 hours) and in   those cases refractory to injection therapy and distal shunting.,Weak
"If a shunt has been performed, then implantation of a penile prosthesis should be delayed   to minimise the risk of infection and erosion of the implant.",Strong
"The decision on which type of implant to insert is dependent on patient suitability, surgeons’   experience and availability and cost of the equipment. If malleable penile prosthesis is   implanted it can be later exchanged to an ınflatable penıle implant.",Strong
Patients must be fully counselled regarding the risks and benefits of implant insertion in   cases of delayed presentation of refractory priapism.,Weak
