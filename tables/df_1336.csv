"4.12.1	  Diagnosing bladder outlet obstruction  Pressure flow studies are used to diagnose and define the severity of BOO, which is characterised by   increased detrusor pressure and decreased urinary flow rate during voiding. Bladder outlet obstruction/BPO   has to be differentiated from DU, which exhibits decreased detrusor pressure during voiding in combination   with decreased urinary flow rate [5].  Urodynamic testing may also identify DO. Studies have described an association between BOO and   DO [98, 99]. In men with LUTS attributed to BPO, DO was present in 61% and independently associated with   BOO grade and ageing [98].  The prevalence of DU in men with LUTS is 11-40% [100, 101]. Detrusor contractility does not   appear to decline in long-term BOO and surgical relief of BOO does not improve contractility [102, 103].   The UPSTREAM trial investigated whether urodynamics would reduce surgery without increasing urinary   symptoms. UPSTREAM was a non-inferiority, RCT in men with bothersome LUTS, in whom surgery was an   option, in 26 hospitals in England. In the UDS arm, 153/408 patients (38%) received surgery compared with   138/384 (36%) in the routine care (RC) arm. A total of 428 adverse events were recorded, with related events   similar in both arms and eleven unrelated deaths. The UDS group was non-inferior to the RC group for IPSS,   and UDS did not significantly reduce surgical rates. The authors concluded that routine use of UDS in the   evaluation of uncomplicated LUTS has a limited role and should be used selectively [104]. If urodynamic   investigation is performed, a rigorous quality control is mandatory [105, 106].  Due to the invasive nature of the test, a urodynamic investigation is generally only offered if   conservative and medical treatment have failed. The Guidelines Panel attempted to identify specific indications   for UDS based on age, findings from other diagnostic tests and previous treatments. The Panel allocated   a different degree of obligation for UDS in men > 80 years and men < 50 years, which reflects the lack of   evidence. In addition, there was no consensus whether UDS should or may be performed when considering   surgery in men with bothersome predominantly voiding LUTS and Qmax > 10 mL/s, although the Panel   recognised that with a Qmax < 10 mL/s, BOO is likely and UDS is not necessarily needed.  Patients with neurological disease, including those with previous radical pelvic surgery, should be   assessed according to the EAU Guidelines on Neuro-Urology [107].",
Summary of evidence,LE
"Patients with a history of microscopic or gross haematuria, urethral stricture, or bladder cancer, who   present with LUTS, should undergo urethrocystoscopy during diagnostic evaluation.",3
No study clearly identified a strong association between the urethrocystoscopic and urodynamic   findings.,3
