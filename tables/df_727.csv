Summary of evidence,LE
The EAU NMIBC 2021 scoring model and risk tables predict the short- and long-term risks of disease   progression in individual patients with primary NMIBC using either the WHO 1973 or the WHO 2022   classification system (see Section 6.1.2.1).,2b
The 2006 EORTC scoring model and risk tables predict the short- and long-term risks of disease   recurrence and progression in individual patients with NMIBC using the WHO 1973 classification   system (see Section 6.1.1.1).,1b
"Patients with Ta G1/G2 tumours receiving chemotherapy have been further stratified into 3 risk groups   for recurrence, taking into account the history of recurrences, history of intravesical treatment, tumour   grade (WHO 1973), number of tumours and adjuvant chemotherapy (see Section 6.1.1.2).",2b
"In patients treated with 5 to 6 months of BCG, the CUETO scoring model predicts the short- and    long-term risks of disease recurrence and progression using the WHO 1973 classification system    (see Section 6.1.1.3).",1b
In patients receiving at least 1 year of BCG maintenance; prior recurrence rate and number of tumours   are the most important prognostic factors for disease recurrence. Stage and grade are the most   important prognostic factors for disease progression and disease-specific survival; patient age and   grade (WHO 1973) are the most important prognostic factors for OS (see Section 6.1.1.4).,1b
